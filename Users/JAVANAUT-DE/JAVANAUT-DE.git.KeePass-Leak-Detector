### What is this repository for? ###

KeePass Leak Detector

Version 1.0

Created on 18.01.2019 by Javanaut

This script searches your KeePass-Database for passwords
that were known to be leaked. API of haveibeenpwned.com is
used to check if a password was leaked. The script will not 
send any passwords in plaintext to the server. The k-Anonymity 
mechanism of the haveibeenpwned.com is used to send a fraction
of the hash of every password to the server and analyses the 
response to check if a password is known to be compromitted.

### Plugin ###

There is also a plug-in for KeePass 2.x integrating check for
compromitted passwords that is not from me. It can be found here:
