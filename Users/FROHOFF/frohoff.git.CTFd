    Update CHANGELOG and add release date (#1852)
    
    # 3.3.0 / 2020-03-26
    
    **General**
    
    - Don't require a team for viewing challenges if Challenge visibility is set to public
    - Add a `THEME_FALLBACK` config to help develop themes. See **Themes** section for details.
    
    **API**
    
    - Implement a faster `/api/v1/scoreboard` endpoint in Teams Mode
    - Add the `solves` item to both `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[challenge_id]` to more easily determine how many solves a challenge has
    - Add the `solved_by_me` item to both `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[challenge_id]` to more easily determine if the current account has solved the challenge
    - Prevent admins from deleting themselves through `DELETE /api/v1/users/[user_id]`
    - Add length checking to some sensitive fields in the Pages and Challenges schemas
    - Fix issue where `PATCH /api/v1/users[user_id]` returned a list instead of a dict
    - Fix exception that occured on demoting admins through `PATCH /api/v1/users[user_id]`
    - Add `team_id` to `GET /api/v1/users` to determine if a user is already in a team
    - Provide a more useful error message when using an expired token
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Add a `THEME_FALLBACK` config to help develop themes.
      - `THEME_FALLBACK` will configure CTFd to try to find missing theme files in the default built-in `core` theme.
      - This makes it easier to develop themes or use incomplete themes.
    - Allow for one theme to reference and inherit from another theme through approaches like `{% extends "core/page.html" %}`
    - Allow for the automatic date rendering format to be overridden by specifying a `data-time-format` attribute.
    - Add styling for the `<blockquote>` element.
    - Change `users/private.html`, `users/public.html` to show awards before a user gets a solve
    - Change `teams/private.html`, `teams/public.html` to show awards before a team gets a solve
    - Change `colorHash` function to use HSL color values to avoid generating too light/dark colors
    - Fix an issue where hidden users couldn't see their graphing data on their private user page (`/user`)
    - Fix scoreboard table identifier to switch between User/Team depending on configured user mode
    - Switch the challenges page in core to use the new API information in `/api/v1/challenges` to mark solves and display solve counts
    - Switch to using Bootstrap's scss in `core/main.scss` to allow using Bootstrap variables
    - Consolidate Jinja error handlers into a single function and better handle issues where error templates can't be found
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - Set plugin migration version after successful migrations
    - Fix issue where Page URLs injected into the navbar were relative instead of absolute
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Add User standings as well as Teams standings to the admin scoreboard when in Teams Mode
    - Add a UI for adding members to a team from the team's admin page
    - Add ability for admins to disable public team creation
    - Link directly to users who submitted something in the submissions page if the CTF is in Teams Mode
    - Fix Challenge Requirements interface in Admin Panel to not allow empty/null requirements to be added
    - Fixed an issue where config times (start, end, freeze times) could not be removed
    - Fix an exception that occurred when demoting an Admin user
    - Adds a temporary hack for re-enabling Javascript snippets in Flag editor templates. (See #1779)
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - Fix boolean configs from the `config.ini` optional section
    - Install `python3-dev` instead of `python-dev` in apt
    - Require `pybluemonday` as pip dependency
    - Remove `lxml` and `html5lib` from pip dependencies
    - Bump `Jinja2` to 2.11.3
    - Bump `pip-tools` to 5.4.0
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - Rewrite the HTML santiziation feature (controlled by `HTML_SANITIZATION`) to use the `pybluemonday` library instead of `lxml`/`html5lib`
      - Note that this feature is still in beta
    - Cache Docker builds more by copying and installing Python dependencies before copying CTFd
    - Change the default emails slightly and rework confirmation email page to make some recommendations clearer
    - Use `examplectf.com` as testing/development domain instead of `ctfd.io`
    - Fix issue where user's name and email would not appear in logs properly
    - Add more linting by also linting with `flake8-comprehensions` and `flake8-bugbear`
    - Add `.pyc` files and `__pycache__` to `.dockerignore`

    3.3.0 (#1833)
    
    # 3.3.0 / UNRELEASED
    
    **General**
    
    - Don't require a team for viewing challenges if Challenge visibility is set to public
    - Add a `THEME_FALLBACK` config to help develop themes. See **Themes** section for details.
    
    **API**
    
    - Implement a faster `/api/v1/scoreboard` endpoint in Teams Mode
    - Add the `solves` item to both `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[challenge_id]` to more easily determine how many solves a challenge has
    - Add the `solved_by_me` item to both `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[challenge_id]` to more easily determine if the current account has solved the challenge
    - Prevent admins from deleting themselves through `DELETE /api/v1/users/[user_id]`
    - Add length checking to some sensitive fields in the Pages and Challenges schemas
    - Fix issue where `PATCH /api/v1/users[user_id]` returned a list instead of a dict
    - Fix exception that occured on demoting admins through `PATCH /api/v1/users[user_id]`
    - Add `team_id` to `GET /api/v1/users` to determine if a user is already in a team
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Add a `THEME_FALLBACK` config to help develop themes.
      - `THEME_FALLBACK` will configure CTFd to try to find missing theme files in the default built-in `core` theme.
      - This makes it easier to develop themes or use incomplete themes.
    - Allow for one theme to reference and inherit from another theme through approaches like `{% extends "core/page.html" %}`
    - Allow for the automatic date rendering format to be overridden by specifying a `data-time-format` attribute.
    - Add styling for the `<blockquote>` element.
    - Fix scoreboard table identifier to switch between User/Team depending on configured user mode
    - Switch to using Bootstrap's scss in `core/main.scss` to allow using Bootstrap variables
    - Consolidate Jinja error handlers into a single function and better handle issues where error templates can't be found
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - Set plugin migration version after successful migrations
    - Fix issue where Page URLs injected into the navbar were relative instead of absolute
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Add User standings as well as Teams standings to the admin scoreboard when in Teams Mode
    - Add a UI for adding members to a team from the team's admin page
    - Add ability for admins to disable public team creation
    - Link directly to users who submitted something in the submissions page if the CTF is in Teams Mode
    - Fix Challenge Requirements interface in Admin Panel to not allow empty/null requirements to be added
    - Fixed an issue where config times (start, end, freeze times) could not be removed
    - Fix an exception that occurred when demoting an Admin user
    - Adds a temporary hack for re-enabling Javascript snippets in Flag editor templates. (See #1779)
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - Install `python3-dev` instead of `python-dev` in apt
    - Bump lxml to 4.6.2
    - Bump pip-compile to 5.4.0
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - Cache Docker builds more by copying and installing Python dependencies before copying CTFd
    - Change the default emails slightly and rework confirmation email page to make some recommendations clearer
    - Use `examplectf.com` as testing/development domain instead of `ctfd.io`
    - Fixes issue where user's name and email would not appear in logs properly
    - Add more linting by also linting with `flake8-comprehensions` and `flake8-bugbear`

    Add length error content that is too long (#1787)
    
    * Add length checking to some sensitive fields in Pages and Challenges.
    * Works on #1786
    
    This is enough to fix most of the issues but this is really a systemic problem for most of the API endpoints. We should have something that verifies data consistency. Marshmallow is not good enough at this. Pydantic seems like it would be superior here.

    Mark 3.2.1 (#1757)
    
    # 3.2.1 / 2020-12-09
    
    - Fixed an issue where Users could not unlock hints

commit f0c65a47ed05af64c8c2e39e2d3054f565a2b645
Author: Kevin Chung <kchung@ctfd.io>
Date:   Mon Dec 7 17:00:38 2020 -0500

    Mark 3.2.0 release date in CHANGELOG (#1756)
    
    # 3.2.0 / 2020-12-07
    
    **General**
    
    - Add Team invites.
      - Team invites are links containing a token that allow a user to join a team without knowing the team password
      - Captains can generate invite tokens for their teams
      - Admins can generate Team invite links as well
    - Improved Team handling
      - Prevent team joining while already on a team
      - Return 403 instead of 200 for team join/create errors
      - Allow team captains whose teams haven't done anything to disband their team
    - Allow for uploading navbar logo, favicon, and index page banner during initial setup
    - Fixed issue in teams mode where a user couldn't unlock a hint despite their team having enough points
      - The fix for this is essentially to allow the user's points to go negative
    - Imports have been made more stable
      - This is primarily done by killing MySQL processes that are locking metadta
      - This is a subpar approach but it seems to be the only solution to avoid a metadata lock in MySQL. This approach did not appear to be needed under Postgres or SQLite
    
    **API**
    
    - Addition of `POST /api/v1/teams/me/members` to generate invite tokens for teams
    - Fixed an issue in `POST /api/v1/awards` where CTFd would 500 when a user could not be found by the provided `user_id`
    - `POST /api/v1/unlocks` in teams mode now uses the team's score to determine if a user can purchase a hint
      - Properly check for existing unlocks in teams mode in `POST /api/v1/unlocks`
    - `/api/v1/notifications` and `/api/v1/notifications/[notification_id]` now have an html parameter which specifies the rendered content of the notification content
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Add Team Invite icon and Disband Team icon to teams/private.html
    - Add teams/invite.html file to handle team joining with invites
    - Added syntax highlighting to challenge descriptions, pages, hints, notifications, comments, and markdown editors
      - This is done with `highlight.js` which has been added to `package.json`
    - Fix notifications to properly fix/support Markdown and HTML notifications
      - Notifications SQL Model now has an html propery
      - Notifications API schemas now has an html field
    - Removed MomentJS (see https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) in favor of dayjs
      - dayjs is mostly API compatible with MomentJS. The only major changes were:
        - dayjs always uses browser local time so you don't need to call `.local()`
        - dayjs segments out some MomentJS functionality into plugins which need to be imported in before using those features
    - Fixed issue in `challenge.html` where the current attempt count would have a typo
    - Fixed issue in `challenge.html` where the max attempts for a challenge would not show if it was set to 1
    - Edit donut charts to have easier to read legends and labels
    - Make data zoom bars thinner and more transparent
    - Add logo, banner, and favicon settings to the setup.html
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - The `auth.register` (`/register`) endpoint now accepts a `?next=` parameter to define where to redirect to after registration
    - There is now a `registered_only` decorator to redirect users to `auth.register` (`/register`) instead of `auth.login` (`/login`)
    - Don't run `db.create_all()` as much during plugin upgrade or during imports
      - By avoiding this we can let alembic and migrations do more of the table creation work but this means that plugins specifically opt into `app.db.create_all()` and will not implicitly get it through `upgrade()`.
      - This means plugins that run `upgrade()` without a migrations folder (no idea who would do this really) will need to upgrade their code.
    - The plugin `upgrade()` function now accepts a `lower` parameter which specifies what lower revision should be used to start from.
      - This is used to support plugin migrations during import so that we can import data directly at the point that the import was taken from
      - `lower="current"` means to use the current revision and `lower=None` would mean to use the absolute base revision (e.g. plugin's first installation)
      - By default this doesn't change `upgrade()` behavior
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Add Favicon uploading to the Admin Panel
    - Move Logo uploading to the Theme tab in the Admin Panel
    - The challenge left side bar tabs have been rewritten into VueJS components.
      - This fixes a number of issues with the consistency of what data is deleted/edited in the challenge editor
      - This also prevents having to refresh the page in most challenge editing situations
    - Fixed a possible bug where the update available alert wouldn't go away on server restart
    - Examples for regex flags are now provided
    - Wrong submissions has been renamed to Incorrect Submissions
    - Graphs in the Admin Statistics page will now scroll with mouse wheel to improve browsing large datasets
    - Fixed an issue where Users/Teams could be created with a null password
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - A restart policy set to `always` has been added to nginx in docker-compose
    - Rename `requirements.txt` to `requirements.in` and generate `requirements.txt` using `pip-tools` under Python 3.6
    - `UPLOAD_PROVIDER` no longer has a default `filesystem` set in config.ini. Instead it is defaulted through `config.py`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - The `psycopg2` dependency in development.txt has been removed in favor of `psycopg2-binary` which was updated to 2.8.6
    - The `moto` dependency in development.txt has been updated to 1.3.16
    - Add `pip-tools` to `development.txt`
    - Add `import_ctf` and `export_ctf` commands to `manage.py` and deprecate `import.py` and `export.py`
    - Override the `MAIL_SERVER` config with the `TESTING_MAIL_SERVER` envvar during tests
    - `ping` events in the notification event handler have been fixed to not send duplicates

    Add a lower parameter to the plugin upgrade() function to help importing (#1755)
    
    - The plugin `upgrade()` function now accepts a `lower` parameter which specifies what lower revision should be used to start from.

    Mark 3.2.0 (#1748)
    
    # 3.2.0 / unreleased
    
    **General**
    
    - Add Team invites.
      - Team invites are links containing a token that allow a user to join a team without knowing the team password
      - Captains can generate invite tokens for their teams
      - Admins can generate Team invite links as well
    - Improved Team handling
      - Prevent team joining while already on a team
      - Return 403 instead of 200 for team join/create errors
      - Allow team captains whose teams haven't done anything to disband their team
    - Allow for uploading navbar logo, favicon, and index page banner during initial setup
    - Fixed issue in teams mode where a user couldn't unlock a hint despite their team having enough points
      - The fix for this is essentially to allow the user's points to go negative
    - Imports have been made more stable
      - This is primarily done by killing MySQL processes that are locking metadta
      - This is a subpar approach but it seems to be the only solution to avoid a metadata lock in MySQL. This approach did not appear to be needed under Postgres or SQLite
    - Update some migrations to first check if a table already exists.
    
    **API**
    
    - Addition of `POST /api/v1/teams/me/members` to generate invite tokens for teams
    - Fixed an issue in `POST /api/v1/awards` where CTFd would 500 when a user could not be found by the provided `user_id`
    - `POST /api/v1/unlocks` in teams mode now uses the team's score to determine if a user can purchase a hint
      - Properly check for existing unlocks in teams mode in `POST /api/v1/unlocks`
    - `/api/v1/notifications` and `/api/v1/notifications/[notification_id]` now have an html parameter which specifies the rendered content of the notification content
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Added syntax highlighting to challenge descriptions, pages, hints, notifications, comments, and markdown editors
      - This is done with `highlight.js` which has been added to `package.json`
    - Fix notifications to properly fix/support Markdown and HTML notifications
      - Notifications SQL Model now has an html propery
      - Notifications API schemas now has an html field
    - Removed MomentJS (see https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) in favor of dayjs
      - dayjs is mostly API compatible with MomentJS. The only major changes were:
        - dayjs always uses browser local time so you don't need to call `.local()`
        - dayjs segments out some MomentJS functionality into plugins which need to be imported in before using those features
    - Fixed issue in `challenge.html` where the current attempt count would have a typo
    - Fixed issue in `challenge.html` where the max attempts for a challenge would not show if it was set to 1
    - Edit donut charts to have easier to read legends and labels
    - Make data zoom bars thinner and more transparent
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - Don't run `db.create_all()` as much during plugin upgrade or during imports
      - By avoiding this we can let alembic and migrations do more of the table creation work but this means that plugins specifically opt into `app.db.create_all()` and will not implicitly get it through `upgrade()`.
      - This means plugins that run `upgrade()` without a migrations folder (no idea who would do this really) will need to upgrade their code.
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Add Favicon uploading to the Admin Panel
    - Move Logo uploading to the Theme tab in the Admin Panel
    - The challenge left side bar tabs have been rewritten into VueJS components.
      - This fixes a number of issues with the consistency of what data is deleted/edited in the challenge editor
      - This also prevents having to refresh the page in most challenge editing situations
    - Fixed a possible bug where the update available alert wouldn't go away on server restart
    - Examples for regex flags are now provided
    - Wrong submissions has been renamed to Incorrect Submissions
    - Graphs in the Admin Statistics page will now scroll with mouse wheel to improve browsing large datasets
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - A restart policy set to `always` has been added to nginx in docker-compose
    - Rename `requirements.txt` to `requirements.in` and generate `requirements.txt` using `pip-tools` under Python 3.6
    - `UPLOAD_PROVIDER` no longer has a default `filesystem` set in config.ini. Instead it is defaulted through `config.py`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - The `psycopg2` dependency in development.txt has been removed in favor of `psycopg2-binary` which was updated to 2.8.6
    - The `moto` dependency in development.txt has been updated to 1.3.16

    - Override the `MAIL_SERVER` config with the `TESTING_MAIL_SERVER` envvar during tests

    I tested that this works in Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. A useful project would be to add installing deps to Github Actions.
    I'll subscribe to https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses/pull/161 since this is IMO a bug in dataclasses.

    Mark 3.1.0 (#1634)
    
    # 3.1.0 / 2020-09-08
    
    **General**
    
    - Loosen team password confirmation in team settings to also accept the team captain's password to make it easier to change the team password
    - Adds the ability to add custom user and team fields for registration/profile settings.
    - Improve Notifications pubsub events system to use a subscriber per server instead of a subscriber per browser. This should improve the reliability of CTFd at higher load and make it easier to deploy the Notifications system
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Add a comments functionality for admins to discuss challenges, users, teams, pages
    - Adds a legal section in Configs where users can add a terms of service and privacy policy
    - Add a Custom Fields section in Configs where admins can add/edit custom user/team fields
    - Move user graphs into a modal for Admin Panel
    
    **API**
    
    - Add `/api/v1/comments` to manipulate and create comments
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Make scoreboard caching only cache the score table instead of the entire page. This is done by caching the specific template section. Refer to #1586, specifically the changes in `scoreboard.html`.
    - Add rel=noopener to external links to prevent tab napping attacks
    - Change the registration page to reference links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy if specified in configuration
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - Make team settings modal larger in the core theme
    - Update tests in Github Actions to properly test under MySQL and Postgres
    - Make gevent default in serve.py and add a `--disable-gevent` switch in serve.py
    - Add `tenacity` library for retrying logic
    - Add `pytest-sugar` for slightly prettier pytest output
    - Add a `listen()` method to `CTFd.utils.events.EventManager` and `CTFd.utils.events.RedisEventManager`.
      - This method should implement subscription for a CTFd worker to whatever underlying notification system there is. This should be implemented with gevent or a background thread.
      - The `subscribe()` method (which used to implement the functionality of the new `listen()` function) now only handles passing notifications from CTFd to the browser. This should also be implemented with gevent or a background thread.

    Mark 3.0.0 (#1572)
    
    # 3.0.0 / 2020-07-27
    
    ## Changelog Summary
    
    The CTFd v3 Changelog represents the changes from v2.5.0 to v3. It is a summarized version of the changes that occured in all CTFd v3 beta/alpha releases.
    
    CTFd v3 contains some breaking changes but many plugins remain compatible. Themes will need some minor changes to be compatible with v3.
    
    These changes are made with great consideration to existing installations and for the health of the overall CTFd project. If you rely on specific behavior, you can always download the last CTFd v2 release on Github. Official plugin/theme updates will be sent to the email addresses on file.
    
    The major changes in CTFd v3 are as follows with the detailed changelog beneath:
    
    - ### Server Side HTML/Markdown Rendering
    
    HTML rendering in some cases (challenge description rendering, hint content rendering) has been moved to the server side. Previously it was rendered by the browser but this led to a lot of duplicated behavior and complexity in some plugins. Rendering that HTML content on the server allows CTFd to take more advantage of theme content and reduce duplicated code across themes.
    
    In addition, HTML sanitization can be enabled on the CTFd installation to prevent the injection of malicious scripts in HTML content.
    
    - ### CommonMark
    
    CTFd now uses [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) for HTML/Markdown rendering. This leads to much more consistent rendering of HTML/Markdown content.
    
    In some cases, this can break your HTML output. You can use our [development testing script](https://gist.github.com/ColdHeat/085c47359ab86c18864135a198cbe505) to check if your HTML output will change and correct it accordingly.
    
    - ### Forms, Nonces, Sessions
    
    CTFd no longer directly injects values into the global session object for a theme. You may have used this as `{{ nonce }}` or `{{ id }}`. Instead these values should be accessed via the `Session` global as so: `{{ Session.nonce }}`.
    
    All of the public facing forms in CTFd have been converted to form globals with WTForms. You can access them via the `Form` global in Jinja. For example, `{{ Forms.auth.LoginForm() }}`. A `{{ form.nonce() }}` function is available on all forms for easier access to the CSRF nonce as well.
    
    Old forms will still work if the nonce used in the form is updated to `{{ Session.nonce }}`.
    
    Values provided by configuration and plugins can now be accessed via the `Configs` and `Plugins` globals. For example `{{ Configs.ctf_name }}` and `{{ Plugins.scripts }}`. See the `base.html` file of the core theme to get an idea of how to use these values.
    
    - ### Challenge Type Plugin Enhancements
    
    Challenge type plugins now have better re-useability with the rest of CTFd. Plugin code no longer needs to copy unchanged methods over from the base challenge plugin classes.
    
    In addition, challenge HTML is now rendered on the server side using a new `challenge.html` file provided by the current theme. This means that the theme effectively controls how a challenge should look overall, but the challenge plugin controls the overall content.
    
    - ### Python 3
    
    CTFd v3 is Python 3 only.
    
    - ### Docker image based on Debian
    
    The Docker image used in CTFd is now based on Debian.
    
    - ### config.ini
    
    Instead of editting `config.py` directly, it's now a better idea to edit `config.ini` or provide your configuration via environment variables
    
    ## Detailed Changelog
    
    **General**
    
    - CTFd is now Python 3 only
    - Render markdown with the CommonMark spec provided by `cmarkgfm`
    - HTML/Markdown content is now rendered on the server side in most cases.
      - This includes challenge descriptions, hint content, and page content
    - Ability to render markdown stripped of any malicious JavaScript or HTML.
      - Controlled via the `HTML_SANITIZATION` server side configuration value
    - Inject `Config`, `User`, `Team`, `Session`, and `Plugin` globals into Jinja
    - User sessions no longer store any user-specific attributes.
      - Sessions only store the user's ID, CSRF nonce, and an hmac of the user's password
      - This allows for session invalidation on password changes
    - The user facing side of CTFd now has user and team searching
    - Accept additional profile fields during registration (affiliation, website, country)
      - This does not add additional inputs. Themes or additional JavaScript can add the form inputs.
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Use EasyMDE as an improved description/text editor for Markdown enabled fields.
    - Media Library button now integrated into EasyMDE enabled fields
    - VueJS now used as the underlying implementation for the Media Library
    - Fix setting theme color in Admin Panel
    - Green outline border has been removed from the Admin Panel
    - GeoIP support now available for converting IP addresses to guessed countries
    - Redesign the challenge creation form to use a radio button with challenge type selection instead of a select input
    
    **API**
    
    - Significant overhauls in API documentation provided by Swagger UI and Swagger json
    - Make almost all API endpoints provide filtering and searching capabilities
    - Change `GET /api/v1/config/<config_key>` to return structured data according to ConfigSchema
    - Admins can no longer ban themselves through `PATCH /api/v1/users/[user_id]`
    - Add `html` item for `GET /api/v1/hints/[hint_id]` which contains the rendered HTML of the Hint content
    - Remove `content` from `GET /api/v1/hints`
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Themes now have access to the `Configs` global which provides wrapped access to `get_config`.
      - For example, `{{ Configs.ctf_name }}` instead of `get_ctf_name()` or `get_config('ctf_name')`
    - Themes must now specify a `challenge.html` which control how a challenge should look.
    - The main library for charts has been changed from Plotly to Apache ECharts.
    - Forms have been moved into wtforms for easier form rendering inside of Jinja.
      - From Jinja you can access forms via the Forms global i.e. `{{ Forms }}`
      - This allows theme developers to more easily re-use a form without having to copy-paste HTML.
    - Themes can now provide a theme settings JSON blob which can be injected into the theme with `{{ Configs.theme_settings }}`
    - Core theme now includes the challenge ID in location hash identifiers to always refer the right challenge despite duplicate names
    - Spinner centering has been switched from a hard coded margin in CSS to flexbox CSS classes from Bootstrap
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - Challenge plugins have changed in structure to better allow integration with themes and prevent obtrusive Javascript/XSS.
      - Challenge rendering now uses `challenge.html` from the provided theme.
      - Accessing the challenge view content is now provided by `/api/v1/challenges/<challenge_id>` in the `view` section. This allows for HTML to be properly sanitized and rendered by the server allowing CTFd to remove client side Jinja rendering.
      - `challenge.html` now specifies what's required and what's rendered by the theme. This allows the challenge plugin to avoid having to deal with aspects of the challenge besides the description and input.
      - A more complete migration guide will be provided when CTFd v3 leaves beta
    - Display current attempt count in challenge view when max attempts is enabled
    - `get_standings()`, `get_team_stanadings()`, `get_user_standings()` now has a fields keyword argument that allows for specificying additional fields that SQLAlchemy should return when building the response set.
      - Useful for gathering additional data when building scoreboard pages
    - Flags can now control the message that is shown to the user by raising `FlagException`
    - Fix `override_template()` functionality
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - Enable SQLAlchemy's `pool_pre_ping` by default to reduce the likelihood of database connection issues
    - Mailgun email settings are now deprecated. Admins should move to SMTP email settings instead.
    - Postgres is now considered a second class citizen in CTFd. It is tested against but not a main database backend. If you use Postgres, you are entirely on your own with regards to supporting CTFd.
    - Docker image now uses Debian instead of Alpine. See https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/issues/1215 for rationale.
    - `docker-compose.yml` now uses a non-root user to connect to MySQL/MariaDB
    - `config.py` should no longer be editting for configuration, instead edit `config.ini` or the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - Fix an issue where email sending would be broken if the CTF name contained a colon
    - Lint Markdown files with Prettier
    - Lint Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml in Github Actions
    - Lint JavaScript files with eslint
    - Certain static strings have been converted into Enums for better re-useability throughout the code base
    - Switch to using Github Actions for testing and linting
    - Better handling of missing challenge types. Missing challenge types no longer bring down all other challenges.
    - Documentation has been seperated out into a seperate repo (https://github.com/CTFd/docs).
    - Documentation hosting has moved from ReadTheDocs to Netlify
    - Any links in the codebase to help.ctfd.io have been changed to docs.ctfd.io.

    # 3.0.0a2 / 2020-07-09
    
    **General**
    
    * Accept additional profile fields during registration (affiliation, website, country)
      * This does not add additional inputs. Themes or additional JavaScript can add the form inputs.
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    * Redesign the challenge creation form to use a radio button with challenge type selection instead of a select input

    * Fix issue with `Configs.ctf_name` returning incorrect value
    * Add prerender step back into challenges.js
    * Better handling of missing challenge types. Missing challenge types no longer bring down all other challenges.

    3.0.0a1 (#1523)
    
    Alpha release of CTFd v3.
    
    # 3.0.0a1 / 2020-07-01
    
    **General**
    
    - CTFd is now Python 3 only
    - Render markdown with the CommonMark spec provided by `cmarkgfm`
    - Render markdown stripped of any malicious JavaScript or HTML.
      - This is a significant change from previous versions of CTFd where any HTML content from an admin was considered safe.
    - Inject `Config`, `User`, `Team`, `Session`, and `Plugin` globals into Jinja
    - User sessions no longer store any user-specific attributes.
      - Sessions only store the user's ID, CSRF nonce, and an hmac of the user's password
      - This allows for session invalidation on password changes
    - The user facing side of CTFd now has user and team searching
    - GeoIP support now available for converting IP addresses to guessed countries
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Use EasyMDE as an improved description/text editor for Markdown enabled fields.
    - Media Library button now integrated into EasyMDE enabled fields
    - VueJS now used as the underlying implementation for the Media Library
    - Fix setting theme color in Admin Panel
    - Green outline border has been removed from the Admin Panel
    
    **API**
    
    - Significant overhauls in API documentation provided by Swagger UI and Swagger json
    - Make almost all API endpoints provide filtering and searching capabilities
    - Change `GET /api/v1/config/<config_key>` to return structured data according to ConfigSchema
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Themes now have access to the `Configs` global which provides wrapped access to `get_config`.
      - For example, `{{ Configs.ctf_name }}` instead of `get_ctf_name()` or `get_config('ctf_name')`
    - Themes must now specify a `challenge.html` which control how a challenge should look.
    - The main library for charts has been changed from Plotly to Apache ECharts.
    - Forms have been moved into wtforms for easier form rendering inside of Jinja.
      - From Jinja you can access forms via the Forms global i.e. `{{ Forms }}`
      - This allows theme developers to more easily re-use a form without having to copy-paste HTML.
    - Themes can now provide a theme settings JSON blob which can be injected into the theme with `{{ Configs.theme_settings }}`
    - Core theme now includes the challenge ID in location hash identifiers to always refer the right challenge despite duplicate names
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - Challenge plugins have changed in structure to better allow integration with themes and prevent obtrusive Javascript/XSS.
      - Challenge rendering now uses `challenge.html` from the provided theme.
      - Accessing the challenge view content is now provided by `/api/v1/challenges/<challenge_id>` in the `view` section. This allows for HTML to be properly sanitized and rendered by the server allowing CTFd to remove client side Jinja rendering.
      - `challenge.html` now specifies what's required and what's rendered by the theme. This allows the challenge plugin to avoid having to deal with aspects of the challenge besides the description and input.
      - A more complete migration guide will be provided when CTFd v3 leaves beta
    - Display current attempt count in challenge view when max attempts is enabled
    - `get_standings()`, `get_team_stanadings()`, `get_user_standings()` now has a fields keyword argument that allows for specificying additional fields that SQLAlchemy should return when building the response set.
      - Useful for gathering additional data when building scoreboard pages
    - Flags can now control the message that is shown to the user by raising `FlagException`
    - Fix `override_template()` functionality
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - Enable SQLAlchemy's `pool_pre_ping` by default to reduce the likelihood of database connection issues
    - Mailgun email settings are now deprecated. Admins should move to SMTP email settings instead.
    - Postgres is now considered a second class citizen in CTFd. It is tested against but not a main database backend. If you use Postgres, you are entirely on your own with regards to supporting CTFd.
    - Docker image now uses Debian instead of Alpine. See https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/issues/1215 for rationale.
    - `docker-compose.yml` now uses a non-root user to connect to MySQL/MariaDB
    - `config.py` should no longer be editting for configuration, instead edit `config.ini` or the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`

    Improve response times of /api/v1/scoreboard significantly (#1470)
    
    * Improve response times of `/api/v1/scoreboard` significantly by avoiding hitting the database to get every team member's score
    * Fix issue where a hidden/banned user's score could be revealed as a member of a team
    
    From tests I was able to cut this down from 11s to 0.5s. This endpoint also will still be heavily cached which should improve performance for a lot of users.

    2.5.0 dev (#1453)
    
    2.5.0 / 2020-06-02
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Use a session invalidation strategy inspired by Django. Newly generated user sessions will now include a HMAC of the user's password. When the user's password is changed by someone other than the user the previous HMACs will no longer be valid and the user will be logged out when they next attempt to perform an action.
    * A user and team's place, and score are now cached and invalidated on score changes.
    
    **API**
    * Add `/api/v1/challenges?view=admin` to allow admin users to see all challenges regardless of their visibility state
    * Add `/api/v1/users?view=admin` to allow admin users to see all users regardless of their hidden/banned state
    * Add `/api/v1/teams?view=admin` to allow admin users to see all teams regardless of their hidden/banned state
    * The scoreboard endpoints `/api/v1/scoreboard` & `/api/v1/scoreboard/top/[count]` should now be more performant because score and place for Users/Teams are now cached
    
    **Deployment**
    * `docker-compose` now provides a basic nginx configuration and deploys nginx on port 80
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * The `get_config` and `get_page` config utilities now use SQLAlchemy Core instead of SQLAlchemy ORM for slight speedups
    * Update Flask-Migrate to 2.5.3 and regenerate the migration environment. Fixes using `%` signs in database passwords.

    2.4.3 / 2020-05-24

    * Change `import_ctf()` process slightly to import built-in tables first and then plugin tables
    * Handle exception where a regex Flag is invalid
    
    **API**
    * File deletion endpoint (`DELETE /api/v1/files/[file_id]`) will now correctly delete the associated file
    
    **Plugins**
    * Add `CTFd.plugins.get_plugin_names()` to get a list of available plugins
    * Add `CTFd.plugins.migrations.current()` to get the current revision of a plugin migration
    * Improve `CTFd.plugins.migrations.upgrade()` to be able to upgrade to a specific plugin migration
    * Run plugin migrations during import process
    
    **Themes**

    Merge pull request #1361 from CTFd/2.4.0-dev
    
    2.4.0 / 2020-05-04
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Cache user and team attributes and use those perform certain page operations intead of going to the database for data
        * After modifying the user/team attributes you should call the appropriate cache clearing function (clear_user_session/clear_team_session)
    * Cache user IPs for the last hour to avoid hitting the database on every authenticated page view
        * Update the user IP's last seen value at least every hour or on every non-GET request
    * Replace `flask_restplus` with `flask_restx`
    * Remove `datafreeze`, `normality`, and `banal` dependencies in favor of in-repo solutions to exporting database
    
    **Admin Panel**
    * Add bulk selection and deletion for Users, Teams, Scoreboard, Challenges, Submissions
    * Make some Admin tables sortable by table headers
    * Create a score distribution graph in the statistics page
    * Make instance reset more granular to allow for choosing to reset Accounts, Submissions, Challenges, Pages, and/or Notificatoins
    * Properly update challenge visibility after updating challenge
    * Show total possible points in Statistics page
    * Add searching for Users, Teams, Challenges, Submissions
    * Move User IP addresses into a modal
    * Move Team IP addresses into a modal
    * Show User website in a user page button
    * Show Team website in a team page button
    * Make the Pages editor use proper HTML syntax highlighting
    * Theme header and footer editors now use CodeMirror
    * Make default CodeMirror font-size 12px
    * Stop storing last action via location hash and switch to using sessionStorage
    
    **Themes**
    * Make page selection a select and option instead of having a lot of page links
    * Add the JSEnum class to create constants that can be accessed from webpack. Generate constants with `python manage.py build jsenums`
    * Add the JinjaEnum class to inject constants into the Jinja environment to access from themes
    * Update jQuery to 3.5.0 to resolve potential security issue
    * Add some new CSS utilities (`.min-vh-*` and `.opacity-*`)
    * Change some rows to have a minimum height so they don't render oddly without data
    * Deprecate `.spinner-error` CSS class
    * Deprecate accessing the type variable to check user role. Instead you should use `is_admin()`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * Enable foreign key enforcement for SQLite. Only really matters for the debug server.
    * Remove the duplicated `get_config` from `CTFd.models`
    * Fix possible email sending issues in Python 3 by using `EmailMessage`
    * Dont set User type in the user side session. Instead it should be set in the new user attributes
    * Fix flask-profiler and bump dependency to 1.8.1
    * Switch to using the `Faker` library for `populate.py` instead of hardcoded data
    * Add a `yarn lint` command to run eslint on JS files
    * Always insert the current CTFd version at the end of the import process
    * Fix issue where files could not be downloaded on Windows

    Mark 2.3.2 (#1292)
    
    2.3.2 / 2020-03-15
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Fix awards not being properly assigned to teams in `TEAMS_MODE`
    
    **API**
    * Set `/api/v1/statistics/users` route to be admins_only
    * When POST'ing to `/api/v1/awards`, CTFd will look up a user's team ID if `team_id` is not specified
    
    **Admin Panel**
    * Adds a setting to registration visibility to allow for MLC registration while registration is disabled
    * Fix setting theme color during the setup flow and from the Admin Panel
    
    **Themes**
    * Fixes users/admins being able to remove profile settings.
        * Previously a bug prevented users from removing some profile settings. Now the `core` theme stores the initial value of inputs as a `data` attribute and checks for changes when updating data. This should be a temporary hack until a proper front-end framework is in place.
    * Fix `ezToast()` issue that was keeping toast messages visible indefinitely
    * Fix `modal-body` parameters in ezq.js for `ezAlert` and `ezQuery` and fix the progress bar for certain cases in `ezProgressBar`
    * Use `authed()` function to check if user is authed in `base.html`. This fixes an issue where a page could look as if the user was logged in.
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * Fix behavior for `REVERSE_PROXY` config setting when set to a boolean instead of a string
    * Improve `Dockerfile` to run fewer commands and re-use the build cache
    * Add `make coverage` to generate an HTML coverage report
    * Update `coverage` and `pytest-cov` development dependencies

    2.3.0 (#1248)
    
    2.3.0 / 2020-02-17
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * During setup, admins can register their email address with the CTFd LLC newsletter for news and updates
    * Fix editting hints from the admin panel
    * Allow admins to insert HTML code directly into the header and footer (end of body tag) of pages. This replaces and supercedes the custom CSS feature.
        * The `views.custom_css` route has been removed.
    * Admins can now customize the content of outgoing emails and inject certain variables into email content.
    * The `manage.py` script can now manipulate the CTFd Configs table via the `get_config` and `set_config` commands. (e.g. `python manage.py get_config ctf_theme` and `python manage.py set_config ctf_theme core`)
    
    **Themes**
    * Themes should now reference the `theme_header` and `theme_footer` configs instead of the `views.custom_css` endpoint to allow for user customizations. See the `base.html` file of the core theme.
    
    **Plugins**
    * Make `ezq` functions available to `CTFd.js` under `CTFd.ui.ezq`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * Python imports sorted with `isort` and import order enforced
    * Black formatter running on a majority of Python code

    2.2.0 focuses on updating the front end of CTFd to use more modern programming practices and changes some aspects of core CTFd design.

        * The subject allows for injecting custom variable via the new `CTFd.utils.formatters.safe_format()` function

    Mark 2.1.3 (#1036)
    
    2.1.3 / 2019-06-22
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Fix issue with downloading files after CTF end when `view_after_ctf` is enabled
    * Sort solves in admin challenge view by date
    * Link to appropriate user and challenge in team, user, and challenge pages
    * Redirect to `/team` instead of `/challenges` after a user registers in team mode
    * Fixes bug where pages marked as `hidden` weren't loading
    * Remove `data-href` from `pages.html` in the Admin Panel to fix the delete button
    * Add UI to handle team member removal in Admin Panel
    * Fixes account links on the scoreboard page created by `update()`. They now correctly point to the user instead of undefined when in user mode.
    * `utils._get_config` will now return `KeyError` instead of `None` to avoid cache misses
    
    **Deployment**
    * Use `/dev/shm` for `--worker-tmp-dir` in gunicorn in Docker
    * Cache `get_place` code for users and teams.
    * Install `Flask-DebugToolbar` in development
    * Cache the `/scoreboard` page to avoid having to rebuild the response so often
    * Make unprivileged `ctfd` user usable for mysql connection in docker-compose by having the db image create the database instead of CTFd
    * Fix bug causing apache2 + mod_wsgi deployments to break
    
    **API**
    * Change `/api/v1/teams/[team_id]/members` from taking `id` to `user_id`.
        * Endpoint was unused so the API change is considered non-breaking.
    * Add `account_type` and `account_url` field in `/api/v1/scoreboard`
    * Separate `/api/v1/[users,teams]/[me,id]/[solves,fails,awards]` into seperate API endpoints
    * Clear standings cache after award creation/deletion
    
    **Exports**
    * Temporarily disable foreign keys in MySQL, MariaDB, and Postgres during `import_ctf()`
    * Add `cache_timeout` parameter to `send_file`response in `/admin/export` to prevent the browser from caching the export
    
    **Tests**
    * Fix score changing test helpers to clear standings cache when generating a score changing row

    Disable foreign keys during import (#1031)
    
    * Temporarily disable foreign keys in MySQL, MariaDB, and Postgres during `import_ctf()`
        * Likely also disables SQLite but SQLite is permissive about foreign keys to begin with so irrelevant.

    Mark 2.1.2 (#994)
    
    2.1.2 / 2019-05-13
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Fix freeze time regressions in 2.x
        * Make `/api/v1/[users,teams]/[me]/[solves,fails,awards]` endpoints load as admin so users can see their solves after freeze
        * Make `/api/v1/challenges/[id]/solves` only show solves before freeze time
            * Add the `?preview=true` GET parameter for admins to preview challenges solves as a user
    * Team join attempts are now ratelimited
    
    **Tests**
    * More linting and autoformatting rules
        * Format Javascript and CSS files with `prettier`: `prettier --write 'CTFd/themes/**/*'`
        * Format Python with `black`: `black CTFd` and `black tests`
        * `make lint` and thus Travis now include the above commands as lint checks
    * Travis now uses xenial instead of trusty.

    * Fix freeze time regressions in 2.x

        * Closes #988
    * Make `/api/v1/challenges/[id]/solves` respect freeze time. `/api/v1/challenges/[id]/solves?preview=true` is exposed for admins to see solves as a user would.

    Mark 2.1.1 (#982)
    
    2.1.1 / 2019-05-04
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Allow admins to hit `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[id]` without having a team to fix challenge previews
    * Fix rate-limiting of flag submission when using team mode
    * Fixes some modal close buttons not working in the admin panel
    * Fixes `populate.py` to assign captains to teams.
    
    **Models**
    * Added `Challenges.flags` relationship and moved the `Flags.challenge` relationship to a backref on Challenges
    * Added `ondelete='CASCADE'` to most ForeignKeys in models allowing for deletions to remove associated data
        * `Hints` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
        * `Tags` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
        * `Flags` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
        * `ChallengeFiles` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
            * Deletion of the file itself is not handled by the model/database
        * `Awards` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
        * `Unlocks` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
        * `Tracking` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
        * `Teams.captain_id` should be set to NULL when the captain user is deleted
    
    **Exports**
    * Force `db.create_all()` to happen for imports on `sqlite` or on failure to create missing tables
    * Force `ctf_theme` to be set to `core` in imports in case a theme is missing from the import or the instance
    * Fix imports/exports to emit and accept JSON properly under MariaDB
        * MariaDB does not properly understand JSON so it must accept strings instead of dicts
        * MariaDB outputs strings instead of JSON for its JSON type so the export serializer will attempt to cast output JSON strings to JSON objects
    
    **Deployment**
    * Run as root when using docker-compose
        * This is necessary to be able to write to the volumes mounted from the host

    challenge update modal is now replaceable (#236)
    
    * challenge update modal is now replaceable
    
    By defining
    * [type]-challenge-update.hbs
    * [type]-challenge-modals.hbs
    * [type]-challenge-update.js
    
    in the /static/admin/js/templates/challenges/[type] folder the
    challenge update modal will be defined for any challenges of
    the given type. This allows for essentially full customizability
    of how you will edit custom challenge types in the admin UI.
    
    The reason for having two files, *update.hbs and *modals.hbs, is
    that *update.hbs defines the body for the main challenge update
    modal, while *modals.hbs defines any additional modals which will be
    used within the main modal
    
    There is one function which is required in *update.js is
    `openchal(id)` which will be passed the id of the challenge to be
    edited and should open the modal as well as load any needed data
    
    * fixed multi-modal issues
    
    Issues were coming from two sources:
    * I had placed the modals in an indirect relationship in the DOM
      tree. They need to be siblings I now see
    * There was double counting of modals within multi-modal.js. This
      only started to appear with the dynamically loaded modals. I
      fixed the script to accurately count modals each time

    Removing functionality from the update keys button
    
    This makes the button do nothing but ultimately the issue is that the
    buttons should automatically update the database through AJAX or
    similar. This is a temporary fix so the Keys modal isn’t an outlier in
    design and doesn’t cause an error.

    Pin Ubuntu version and follow Dockerfile best practices (#218)
    
    Docker provides some useful resources for Ubuntu as a base image
    and installing software via apt-get:
    
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#apt-get
    
    It's also useful to pin the Ubuntu version to 16.04 so we have a good
    idea of what OS we're using in the image. To that end, I think we can
    also avoid performing an upgrade so we can even further control which
    versions of software we're using. If we do an upgrade then you'll have
    different versions of software depending on when you build the image.

    Fix deleting wrong keys from admin panel (#151)
    
    * Fix deleting wrong keys from admin panel
    
    - Fixed wrong_keys.html template using WrongKeys.team instead of
      WrongKeys.teamid
    - Added the id of the wrong key to the wrong_keys.html template entries
    - Changed /admin/wrong_keys to only take the key id instead of team and
      challenge id, to allow deleting the intended key when a team has more
      than one wrong key for a challenge. (Previously it would delete only
      the first wrong key entry for that challenge)
    
    * Have delete_wrong_key use first_or_404
    
    - Switched first() for first_or_404()
    - Changed javascript variable to use underscores instead of camelCase

    Preventing unnecessary requests

commit 2972cf506d4fe94ad265d198b30fa666ea7b40c6
Author: Blake Burkhart <bburky@bburky.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 7 22:11:31 2015 -0600

    Optionally allow unregistered users to view challenges
    
    Add a Config entry `view_challenges_unregistered` to indicate whether
    unregistered users can view challenges. Add the setting to the admin config
    page.
    
    Add can_view_challenges() to utils to test if a user is either authed, or the
    configuration allow unauthenticated users to view the challenges.
    
    Return a HTTP 401 Unauthorized error when the /chals/solves API can't provide
    results for an unauthenticated user. This is needed because the client side
    code in `chalboard.js` doesn't know if it's logged in or not and requests this
    anyway. (And AJAX doesn't handle redirects very well.) Alternately the client
    could actually know if they're logged in and not make needless API calls.
    
    When an unregistered user attempts to submit a flag, it will also fail. The
    user will be redirected to a login page.

    Update CHANGELOG and add release date (#1852)
    
    # 3.3.0 / 2020-03-26
    
    **General**
    
    - Don't require a team for viewing challenges if Challenge visibility is set to public
    - Add a `THEME_FALLBACK` config to help develop themes. See **Themes** section for details.
    
    **API**
    
    - Implement a faster `/api/v1/scoreboard` endpoint in Teams Mode
    - Add the `solves` item to both `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[challenge_id]` to more easily determine how many solves a challenge has
    - Add the `solved_by_me` item to both `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[challenge_id]` to more easily determine if the current account has solved the challenge
    - Prevent admins from deleting themselves through `DELETE /api/v1/users/[user_id]`

    - Provide a more useful error message when using an expired token
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Add a `THEME_FALLBACK` config to help develop themes.
      - `THEME_FALLBACK` will configure CTFd to try to find missing theme files in the default built-in `core` theme.
      - This makes it easier to develop themes or use incomplete themes.
    - Allow for one theme to reference and inherit from another theme through approaches like `{% extends "core/page.html" %}`
    - Allow for the automatic date rendering format to be overridden by specifying a `data-time-format` attribute.
    - Add styling for the `<blockquote>` element.
    - Change `users/private.html`, `users/public.html` to show awards before a user gets a solve
    - Change `teams/private.html`, `teams/public.html` to show awards before a team gets a solve
    - Change `colorHash` function to use HSL color values to avoid generating too light/dark colors
    - Fix an issue where hidden users couldn't see their graphing data on their private user page (`/user`)
    - Fix scoreboard table identifier to switch between User/Team depending on configured user mode
    - Switch the challenges page in core to use the new API information in `/api/v1/challenges` to mark solves and display solve counts
    - Switch to using Bootstrap's scss in `core/main.scss` to allow using Bootstrap variables
    - Consolidate Jinja error handlers into a single function and better handle issues where error templates can't be found
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - Set plugin migration version after successful migrations
    - Fix issue where Page URLs injected into the navbar were relative instead of absolute
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Add User standings as well as Teams standings to the admin scoreboard when in Teams Mode
    - Add a UI for adding members to a team from the team's admin page
    - Add ability for admins to disable public team creation
    - Link directly to users who submitted something in the submissions page if the CTF is in Teams Mode
    - Fix Challenge Requirements interface in Admin Panel to not allow empty/null requirements to be added
    - Fixed an issue where config times (start, end, freeze times) could not be removed
    - Fix an exception that occurred when demoting an Admin user
    - Adds a temporary hack for re-enabling Javascript snippets in Flag editor templates. (See #1779)
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - Fix boolean configs from the `config.ini` optional section
    - Install `python3-dev` instead of `python-dev` in apt
    - Require `pybluemonday` as pip dependency
    - Remove `lxml` and `html5lib` from pip dependencies
    - Bump `Jinja2` to 2.11.3
    - Bump `pip-tools` to 5.4.0
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - Rewrite the HTML santiziation feature (controlled by `HTML_SANITIZATION`) to use the `pybluemonday` library instead of `lxml`/`html5lib`
      - Note that this feature is still in beta
    - Cache Docker builds more by copying and installing Python dependencies before copying CTFd
    - Change the default emails slightly and rework confirmation email page to make some recommendations clearer
    - Use `examplectf.com` as testing/development domain instead of `ctfd.io`
    - Fix issue where user's name and email would not appear in logs properly
    - Add more linting by also linting with `flake8-comprehensions` and `flake8-bugbear`
    - Add `.pyc` files and `__pycache__` to `.dockerignore`

    * Works on #1786
    
    This is enough to fix most of the issues but this is really a systemic problem for most of the API endpoints. We should have something that verifies data consistency. Marshmallow is not good enough at this. Pydantic seems like it would be superior here.

    Mark 3.2.1 (#1757)
    
    # 3.2.1 / 2020-12-09
    
    - Fixed an issue where Users could not unlock hints

commit f0c65a47ed05af64c8c2e39e2d3054f565a2b645
Author: Kevin Chung <kchung@ctfd.io>
Date:   Mon Dec 7 17:00:38 2020 -0500

    Mark 3.2.0 release date in CHANGELOG (#1756)
    
    # 3.2.0 / 2020-12-07
    
    **General**
    
    - Add Team invites.
      - Team invites are links containing a token that allow a user to join a team without knowing the team password
      - Captains can generate invite tokens for their teams
      - Admins can generate Team invite links as well
    - Improved Team handling
      - Prevent team joining while already on a team
      - Return 403 instead of 200 for team join/create errors
      - Allow team captains whose teams haven't done anything to disband their team
    - Allow for uploading navbar logo, favicon, and index page banner during initial setup
    - Fixed issue in teams mode where a user couldn't unlock a hint despite their team having enough points
      - The fix for this is essentially to allow the user's points to go negative
    - Imports have been made more stable
      - This is primarily done by killing MySQL processes that are locking metadta
      - This is a subpar approach but it seems to be the only solution to avoid a metadata lock in MySQL. This approach did not appear to be needed under Postgres or SQLite
    
    **API**
    
    - Addition of `POST /api/v1/teams/me/members` to generate invite tokens for teams
    - Fixed an issue in `POST /api/v1/awards` where CTFd would 500 when a user could not be found by the provided `user_id`
    - `POST /api/v1/unlocks` in teams mode now uses the team's score to determine if a user can purchase a hint
      - Properly check for existing unlocks in teams mode in `POST /api/v1/unlocks`
    - `/api/v1/notifications` and `/api/v1/notifications/[notification_id]` now have an html parameter which specifies the rendered content of the notification content
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Add Team Invite icon and Disband Team icon to teams/private.html
    - Add teams/invite.html file to handle team joining with invites
    - Added syntax highlighting to challenge descriptions, pages, hints, notifications, comments, and markdown editors
      - This is done with `highlight.js` which has been added to `package.json`
    - Fix notifications to properly fix/support Markdown and HTML notifications
      - Notifications SQL Model now has an html propery
      - Notifications API schemas now has an html field
    - Removed MomentJS (see https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) in favor of dayjs
      - dayjs is mostly API compatible with MomentJS. The only major changes were:
        - dayjs always uses browser local time so you don't need to call `.local()`
        - dayjs segments out some MomentJS functionality into plugins which need to be imported in before using those features
    - Fixed issue in `challenge.html` where the current attempt count would have a typo
    - Fixed issue in `challenge.html` where the max attempts for a challenge would not show if it was set to 1
    - Edit donut charts to have easier to read legends and labels
    - Make data zoom bars thinner and more transparent
    - Add logo, banner, and favicon settings to the setup.html
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - The `auth.register` (`/register`) endpoint now accepts a `?next=` parameter to define where to redirect to after registration
    - There is now a `registered_only` decorator to redirect users to `auth.register` (`/register`) instead of `auth.login` (`/login`)
    - Don't run `db.create_all()` as much during plugin upgrade or during imports
      - By avoiding this we can let alembic and migrations do more of the table creation work but this means that plugins specifically opt into `app.db.create_all()` and will not implicitly get it through `upgrade()`.
      - This means plugins that run `upgrade()` without a migrations folder (no idea who would do this really) will need to upgrade their code.
    - The plugin `upgrade()` function now accepts a `lower` parameter which specifies what lower revision should be used to start from.
      - This is used to support plugin migrations during import so that we can import data directly at the point that the import was taken from
      - `lower="current"` means to use the current revision and `lower=None` would mean to use the absolute base revision (e.g. plugin's first installation)
      - By default this doesn't change `upgrade()` behavior
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Add Favicon uploading to the Admin Panel
    - Move Logo uploading to the Theme tab in the Admin Panel
    - The challenge left side bar tabs have been rewritten into VueJS components.
      - This fixes a number of issues with the consistency of what data is deleted/edited in the challenge editor
      - This also prevents having to refresh the page in most challenge editing situations
    - Fixed a possible bug where the update available alert wouldn't go away on server restart
    - Examples for regex flags are now provided
    - Wrong submissions has been renamed to Incorrect Submissions
    - Graphs in the Admin Statistics page will now scroll with mouse wheel to improve browsing large datasets
    - Fixed an issue where Users/Teams could be created with a null password
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - A restart policy set to `always` has been added to nginx in docker-compose
    - Rename `requirements.txt` to `requirements.in` and generate `requirements.txt` using `pip-tools` under Python 3.6
    - `UPLOAD_PROVIDER` no longer has a default `filesystem` set in config.ini. Instead it is defaulted through `config.py`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - The `psycopg2` dependency in development.txt has been removed in favor of `psycopg2-binary` which was updated to 2.8.6
    - The `moto` dependency in development.txt has been updated to 1.3.16
    - Add `pip-tools` to `development.txt`
    - Add `import_ctf` and `export_ctf` commands to `manage.py` and deprecate `import.py` and `export.py`
    - Override the `MAIL_SERVER` config with the `TESTING_MAIL_SERVER` envvar during tests
    - `ping` events in the notification event handler have been fixed to not send duplicates

    Add a lower parameter to the plugin upgrade() function to help importing (#1755)
    
    - The plugin `upgrade()` function now accepts a `lower` parameter which specifies what lower revision should be used to start from.
      - This is used to support plugin migrations during import so that we can import data directly at the point that the import was taken from
      - `lower="current"` means to use the current revision and `lower=None` would mean to use the absolute base revision (e.g. plugin's first installation)
      - By default this doesn't change `upgrade()` behavior

    * Build `requirements.txt` on Python 3.7 to fix an issue with installing dataclasses.
    * Closes #1729
    
    I tested that this works in Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. A useful project would be to add installing deps to Github Actions.
    I'll subscribe to https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses/pull/161 since this is IMO a bug in dataclasses.

    Mark 3.1.0 (#1634)
    
    # 3.1.0 / 2020-09-08
    
    **General**
    
    - Loosen team password confirmation in team settings to also accept the team captain's password to make it easier to change the team password
    - Adds the ability to add custom user and team fields for registration/profile settings.
    - Improve Notifications pubsub events system to use a subscriber per server instead of a subscriber per browser. This should improve the reliability of CTFd at higher load and make it easier to deploy the Notifications system
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Add a comments functionality for admins to discuss challenges, users, teams, pages
    - Adds a legal section in Configs where users can add a terms of service and privacy policy
    - Add a Custom Fields section in Configs where admins can add/edit custom user/team fields
    - Move user graphs into a modal for Admin Panel
    
    **API**
    
    - Add `/api/v1/comments` to manipulate and create comments
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Make scoreboard caching only cache the score table instead of the entire page. This is done by caching the specific template section. Refer to #1586, specifically the changes in `scoreboard.html`.
    - Add rel=noopener to external links to prevent tab napping attacks
    - Change the registration page to reference links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy if specified in configuration
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - Make team settings modal larger in the core theme
    - Update tests in Github Actions to properly test under MySQL and Postgres
    - Make gevent default in serve.py and add a `--disable-gevent` switch in serve.py
    - Add `tenacity` library for retrying logic
    - Add `pytest-sugar` for slightly prettier pytest output
    - Add a `listen()` method to `CTFd.utils.events.EventManager` and `CTFd.utils.events.RedisEventManager`.
      - This method should implement subscription for a CTFd worker to whatever underlying notification system there is. This should be implemented with gevent or a background thread.
      - The `subscribe()` method (which used to implement the functionality of the new `listen()` function) now only handles passing notifications from CTFd to the browser. This should also be implemented with gevent or a background thread.

    - Values specified in `config.ini` will now supercede values specified via environment variable. Config behavior is as follows:
      1. Config Key exists in `config.ini` and is set to a value. That value becomes the app config.
      2. Config Key exists in `config.ini` but is set to an empty string. An envvar with the same name is looked up. The envvar's value is used as the app config.
      3. If the envvar is not found, fall back to the default specified value in `config.py`
      4. If there is no default, use None or an empty string

    Mark 3.0.0 (#1572)
    
    # 3.0.0 / 2020-07-27
    
    ## Changelog Summary
    
    The CTFd v3 Changelog represents the changes from v2.5.0 to v3. It is a summarized version of the changes that occured in all CTFd v3 beta/alpha releases.
    
    CTFd v3 contains some breaking changes but many plugins remain compatible. Themes will need some minor changes to be compatible with v3.
    
    These changes are made with great consideration to existing installations and for the health of the overall CTFd project. If you rely on specific behavior, you can always download the last CTFd v2 release on Github. Official plugin/theme updates will be sent to the email addresses on file.
    
    The major changes in CTFd v3 are as follows with the detailed changelog beneath:
    
    - ### Server Side HTML/Markdown Rendering
    
    HTML rendering in some cases (challenge description rendering, hint content rendering) has been moved to the server side. Previously it was rendered by the browser but this led to a lot of duplicated behavior and complexity in some plugins. Rendering that HTML content on the server allows CTFd to take more advantage of theme content and reduce duplicated code across themes.
    
    In addition, HTML sanitization can be enabled on the CTFd installation to prevent the injection of malicious scripts in HTML content.
    
    - ### CommonMark
    
    CTFd now uses [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) for HTML/Markdown rendering. This leads to much more consistent rendering of HTML/Markdown content.
    
    In some cases, this can break your HTML output. You can use our [development testing script](https://gist.github.com/ColdHeat/085c47359ab86c18864135a198cbe505) to check if your HTML output will change and correct it accordingly.
    
    - ### Forms, Nonces, Sessions
    
    CTFd no longer directly injects values into the global session object for a theme. You may have used this as `{{ nonce }}` or `{{ id }}`. Instead these values should be accessed via the `Session` global as so: `{{ Session.nonce }}`.
    
    All of the public facing forms in CTFd have been converted to form globals with WTForms. You can access them via the `Form` global in Jinja. For example, `{{ Forms.auth.LoginForm() }}`. A `{{ form.nonce() }}` function is available on all forms for easier access to the CSRF nonce as well.
    
    Old forms will still work if the nonce used in the form is updated to `{{ Session.nonce }}`.
    
    Values provided by configuration and plugins can now be accessed via the `Configs` and `Plugins` globals. For example `{{ Configs.ctf_name }}` and `{{ Plugins.scripts }}`. See the `base.html` file of the core theme to get an idea of how to use these values.
    
    - ### Challenge Type Plugin Enhancements
    
    Challenge type plugins now have better re-useability with the rest of CTFd. Plugin code no longer needs to copy unchanged methods over from the base challenge plugin classes.
    
    In addition, challenge HTML is now rendered on the server side using a new `challenge.html` file provided by the current theme. This means that the theme effectively controls how a challenge should look overall, but the challenge plugin controls the overall content.
    
    - ### Python 3
    
    CTFd v3 is Python 3 only.
    
    - ### Docker image based on Debian
    
    The Docker image used in CTFd is now based on Debian.
    
    - ### config.ini
    
    Instead of editting `config.py` directly, it's now a better idea to edit `config.ini` or provide your configuration via environment variables
    
    ## Detailed Changelog
    
    **General**
    
    - CTFd is now Python 3 only
    - Render markdown with the CommonMark spec provided by `cmarkgfm`
    - HTML/Markdown content is now rendered on the server side in most cases.
      - This includes challenge descriptions, hint content, and page content
    - Ability to render markdown stripped of any malicious JavaScript or HTML.
      - Controlled via the `HTML_SANITIZATION` server side configuration value
    - Inject `Config`, `User`, `Team`, `Session`, and `Plugin` globals into Jinja
    - User sessions no longer store any user-specific attributes.
      - Sessions only store the user's ID, CSRF nonce, and an hmac of the user's password
      - This allows for session invalidation on password changes
    - The user facing side of CTFd now has user and team searching
    - Accept additional profile fields during registration (affiliation, website, country)
      - This does not add additional inputs. Themes or additional JavaScript can add the form inputs.
    
    **Admin Panel**
    
    - Use EasyMDE as an improved description/text editor for Markdown enabled fields.
    - Media Library button now integrated into EasyMDE enabled fields
    - VueJS now used as the underlying implementation for the Media Library
    - Fix setting theme color in Admin Panel
    - Green outline border has been removed from the Admin Panel
    - GeoIP support now available for converting IP addresses to guessed countries
    - Redesign the challenge creation form to use a radio button with challenge type selection instead of a select input
    
    **API**
    
    - Significant overhauls in API documentation provided by Swagger UI and Swagger json
    - Make almost all API endpoints provide filtering and searching capabilities
    - Change `GET /api/v1/config/<config_key>` to return structured data according to ConfigSchema
    - Admins can no longer ban themselves through `PATCH /api/v1/users/[user_id]`
    - Add `html` item for `GET /api/v1/hints/[hint_id]` which contains the rendered HTML of the Hint content
    - Remove `content` from `GET /api/v1/hints`
    
    **Themes**
    
    - Themes now have access to the `Configs` global which provides wrapped access to `get_config`.
      - For example, `{{ Configs.ctf_name }}` instead of `get_ctf_name()` or `get_config('ctf_name')`
    - Themes must now specify a `challenge.html` which control how a challenge should look.
    - The main library for charts has been changed from Plotly to Apache ECharts.
    - Forms have been moved into wtforms for easier form rendering inside of Jinja.
      - From Jinja you can access forms via the Forms global i.e. `{{ Forms }}`
      - This allows theme developers to more easily re-use a form without having to copy-paste HTML.
    - Themes can now provide a theme settings JSON blob which can be injected into the theme with `{{ Configs.theme_settings }}`
    - Core theme now includes the challenge ID in location hash identifiers to always refer the right challenge despite duplicate names
    - Spinner centering has been switched from a hard coded margin in CSS to flexbox CSS classes from Bootstrap
    
    **Plugins**
    
    - Challenge plugins have changed in structure to better allow integration with themes and prevent obtrusive Javascript/XSS.
      - Challenge rendering now uses `challenge.html` from the provided theme.
      - Accessing the challenge view content is now provided by `/api/v1/challenges/<challenge_id>` in the `view` section. This allows for HTML to be properly sanitized and rendered by the server allowing CTFd to remove client side Jinja rendering.
      - `challenge.html` now specifies what's required and what's rendered by the theme. This allows the challenge plugin to avoid having to deal with aspects of the challenge besides the description and input.
      - A more complete migration guide will be provided when CTFd v3 leaves beta
    - Display current attempt count in challenge view when max attempts is enabled
    - `get_standings()`, `get_team_stanadings()`, `get_user_standings()` now has a fields keyword argument that allows for specificying additional fields that SQLAlchemy should return when building the response set.
      - Useful for gathering additional data when building scoreboard pages
    - Flags can now control the message that is shown to the user by raising `FlagException`
    - Fix `override_template()` functionality
    
    **Deployment**
    
    - Enable SQLAlchemy's `pool_pre_ping` by default to reduce the likelihood of database connection issues
    - Mailgun email settings are now deprecated. Admins should move to SMTP email settings instead.
    - Postgres is now considered a second class citizen in CTFd. It is tested against but not a main database backend. If you use Postgres, you are entirely on your own with regards to supporting CTFd.
    - Docker image now uses Debian instead of Alpine. See https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/issues/1215 for rationale.
    - `docker-compose.yml` now uses a non-root user to connect to MySQL/MariaDB
    - `config.py` should no longer be editting for configuration, instead edit `config.ini` or the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    
    - Fix an issue where email sending would be broken if the CTF name contained a colon
    - Lint Markdown files with Prettier
    - Lint Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml in Github Actions
    - Lint JavaScript files with eslint
    - Certain static strings have been converted into Enums for better re-useability throughout the code base
    - Switch to using Github Actions for testing and linting
    - Better handling of missing challenge types. Missing challenge types no longer bring down all other challenges.
    - Documentation has been seperated out into a seperate repo (https://github.com/CTFd/docs).
    - Documentation hosting has moved from ReadTheDocs to Netlify
    - Any links in the codebase to help.ctfd.io have been changed to docs.ctfd.io.

    Scoreboard optimizations (#1475)
    
    * The top scoreboard endpoint `/api/v1/scoreboard/top/<count>` is now more performant (3x) due to better response generation
    
    In local testing I went from 3.5s to 1.2s.

    Improve response times of /api/v1/scoreboard significantly (#1470)
    
    * Improve response times of `/api/v1/scoreboard` significantly by avoiding hitting the database to get every team member's score
    * Fix issue where a hidden/banned user's score could be revealed as a member of a team
    
    From tests I was able to cut this down from 11s to 0.5s. This endpoint also will still be heavily cached which should improve performance for a lot of users.

    2.5.0 dev (#1453)
    
    2.5.0 / 2020-06-02
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Use a session invalidation strategy inspired by Django. Newly generated user sessions will now include a HMAC of the user's password. When the user's password is changed by someone other than the user the previous HMACs will no longer be valid and the user will be logged out when they next attempt to perform an action.
    * A user and team's place, and score are now cached and invalidated on score changes.
    
    **API**
    * Add `/api/v1/challenges?view=admin` to allow admin users to see all challenges regardless of their visibility state
    * Add `/api/v1/users?view=admin` to allow admin users to see all users regardless of their hidden/banned state
    * Add `/api/v1/teams?view=admin` to allow admin users to see all teams regardless of their hidden/banned state
    * The scoreboard endpoints `/api/v1/scoreboard` & `/api/v1/scoreboard/top/[count]` should now be more performant because score and place for Users/Teams are now cached
    
    **Deployment**
    * `docker-compose` now provides a basic nginx configuration and deploys nginx on port 80
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * The `get_config` and `get_page` config utilities now use SQLAlchemy Core instead of SQLAlchemy ORM for slight speedups
    * Update Flask-Migrate to 2.5.3 and regenerate the migration environment. Fixes using `%` signs in database passwords.

    **API**

    **Plugins**
    * Add `CTFd.plugins.get_plugin_names()` to get a list of available plugins

    * Make Dynamic Challenges have a cascading deletion constraint against their respective Challenge row
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * Add `app.plugins_dir` object to refer to the directory where plugins are installed

    Merge pull request #1361 from CTFd/2.4.0-dev
    
    2.4.0 / 2020-05-04
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Cache user and team attributes and use those perform certain page operations intead of going to the database for data
        * After modifying the user/team attributes you should call the appropriate cache clearing function (clear_user_session/clear_team_session)
    * Cache user IPs for the last hour to avoid hitting the database on every authenticated page view
        * Update the user IP's last seen value at least every hour or on every non-GET request
    * Replace `flask_restplus` with `flask_restx`
    * Remove `datafreeze`, `normality`, and `banal` dependencies in favor of in-repo solutions to exporting database
    
    **Admin Panel**
    * Add bulk selection and deletion for Users, Teams, Scoreboard, Challenges, Submissions
    * Make some Admin tables sortable by table headers
    * Create a score distribution graph in the statistics page
    * Make instance reset more granular to allow for choosing to reset Accounts, Submissions, Challenges, Pages, and/or Notificatoins
    * Properly update challenge visibility after updating challenge
    * Show total possible points in Statistics page
    * Add searching for Users, Teams, Challenges, Submissions
    * Move User IP addresses into a modal
    * Move Team IP addresses into a modal
    * Show User website in a user page button
    * Show Team website in a team page button
    * Make the Pages editor use proper HTML syntax highlighting
    * Theme header and footer editors now use CodeMirror
    * Make default CodeMirror font-size 12px
    * Stop storing last action via location hash and switch to using sessionStorage
    
    **Themes**
    * Make page selection a select and option instead of having a lot of page links
    * Add the JSEnum class to create constants that can be accessed from webpack. Generate constants with `python manage.py build jsenums`
    * Add the JinjaEnum class to inject constants into the Jinja environment to access from themes
    * Update jQuery to 3.5.0 to resolve potential security issue
    * Add some new CSS utilities (`.min-vh-*` and `.opacity-*`)
    * Change some rows to have a minimum height so they don't render oddly without data
    * Deprecate `.spinner-error` CSS class
    * Deprecate accessing the type variable to check user role. Instead you should use `is_admin()`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * Enable foreign key enforcement for SQLite. Only really matters for the debug server.
    * Remove the duplicated `get_config` from `CTFd.models`
    * Fix possible email sending issues in Python 3 by using `EmailMessage`
    * Dont set User type in the user side session. Instead it should be set in the new user attributes
    * Fix flask-profiler and bump dependency to 1.8.1
    * Switch to using the `Faker` library for `populate.py` instead of hardcoded data
    * Add a `yarn lint` command to run eslint on JS files
    * Always insert the current CTFd version at the end of the import process
    * Fix issue where files could not be downloaded on Windows

    Mark 2.3.2 (#1292)
    
    2.3.2 / 2020-03-15
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Fix awards not being properly assigned to teams in `TEAMS_MODE`
    
    **API**
    * Set `/api/v1/statistics/users` route to be admins_only
    * When POST'ing to `/api/v1/awards`, CTFd will look up a user's team ID if `team_id` is not specified
    
    **Admin Panel**
    * Adds a setting to registration visibility to allow for MLC registration while registration is disabled
    * Fix setting theme color during the setup flow and from the Admin Panel
    
    **Themes**
    * Fixes users/admins being able to remove profile settings.
        * Previously a bug prevented users from removing some profile settings. Now the `core` theme stores the initial value of inputs as a `data` attribute and checks for changes when updating data. This should be a temporary hack until a proper front-end framework is in place.
    * Fix `ezToast()` issue that was keeping toast messages visible indefinitely
    * Fix `modal-body` parameters in ezq.js for `ezAlert` and `ezQuery` and fix the progress bar for certain cases in `ezProgressBar`
    * Use `authed()` function to check if user is authed in `base.html`. This fixes an issue where a page could look as if the user was logged in.
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * Fix behavior for `REVERSE_PROXY` config setting when set to a boolean instead of a string
    * Improve `Dockerfile` to run fewer commands and re-use the build cache
    * Add `make coverage` to generate an HTML coverage report
    * Update `coverage` and `pytest-cov` development dependencies

    2.3.0 / 2020-02-17
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * During setup, admins can register their email address with the CTFd LLC newsletter for news and updates
    * Fix editting hints from the admin panel
    * Allow admins to insert HTML code directly into the header and footer (end of body tag) of pages. This replaces and supercedes the custom CSS feature.
        * The `views.custom_css` route has been removed.
    * Admins can now customize the content of outgoing emails and inject certain variables into email content.
    * The `manage.py` script can now manipulate the CTFd Configs table via the `get_config` and `set_config` commands. (e.g. `python manage.py get_config ctf_theme` and `python manage.py set_config ctf_theme core`)
    
    **Themes**
    * Themes should now reference the `theme_header` and `theme_footer` configs instead of the `views.custom_css` endpoint to allow for user customizations. See the `base.html` file of the core theme.
    
    **Plugins**
    * Make `ezq` functions available to `CTFd.js` under `CTFd.ui.ezq`
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * Python imports sorted with `isort` and import order enforced
    * Black formatter running on a majority of Python code

    2.2.0 (#1188)
    
    2.2.0 / 2019-12-22
    ==================
    
    ## Notice
    2.2.0 focuses on updating the front end of CTFd to use more modern programming practices and changes some aspects of core CTFd design. If your current installation is using a custom theme or custom plugin with ***any*** kind of JavaScript, it is likely that you will need to upgrade that theme/plugin to be useable with v2.2.0.

    **Admin Panel**
    * Admins can now user a color input box to specify a theme color which is injected as part of the CSS configuration. Theme developers can use this CSS value to change colors and styles accordingly.

    * Theme asset specially generated URLs
        * Static theme assets are now loaded with either .dev.extension or .min.extension depending on production or development (i.e. debug server)
        * Static theme assets are also given a `d` GET parameter that changes per server start. Used to bust browser caches.
    * Use `defer` for script tags to not block page rendering
    * Only show the MajorLeagueCyber button if configured in configuration
    * The admin panel now links to https://help.ctfd.io/ in the top right
    * Create an `ezToast()` function to use [Bootstrap's toasts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/toasts/)

    **Deployment**
    * Switch `Dockerfile` from `python:2.7-alpine` to `python:3.7-alpine`
    * Add `SERVER_SENT_EVENTS` config value to control whether Notifications are enabled
    * Challenge ID is now recorded in the submission log
    
    **Plugins**
    * Add an endpoint parameter to `register_plugin_assets_directory()` and `register_plugin_asset()` to control what endpoint Flask uses for the added route
    
    **Miscellaneous**
    * `CTFd.utils.email.sendmail()` now allows the caller to specify subject as an argument
        * The subject allows for injecting custom variable via the new `CTFd.utils.formatters.safe_format()` function
    * Admin user information is now error checked during setup
    * Added yarn to the toolchain and the yarn dev, yarn build, yarn verify, and yarn clean scripts
    * Prevent old CTFd imports from being imported

    Mark 2.1.3 (#1036)
    
    2.1.3 / 2019-06-22
    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Fix issue with downloading files after CTF end when `view_after_ctf` is enabled
    * Sort solves in admin challenge view by date
    * Link to appropriate user and challenge in team, user, and challenge pages
    * Redirect to `/team` instead of `/challenges` after a user registers in team mode
    * Fixes bug where pages marked as `hidden` weren't loading
    * Remove `data-href` from `pages.html` in the Admin Panel to fix the delete button
    * Add UI to handle team member removal in Admin Panel
    * Fixes account links on the scoreboard page created by `update()`. They now correctly point to the user instead of undefined when in user mode.
    * `utils._get_config` will now return `KeyError` instead of `None` to avoid cache misses
    
    **Deployment**
    * Use `/dev/shm` for `--worker-tmp-dir` in gunicorn in Docker
    * Cache `get_place` code for users and teams.
    * Install `Flask-DebugToolbar` in development
    * Cache the `/scoreboard` page to avoid having to rebuild the response so often
    * Make unprivileged `ctfd` user usable for mysql connection in docker-compose by having the db image create the database instead of CTFd
    * Fix bug causing apache2 + mod_wsgi deployments to break
    
    **API**
    * Change `/api/v1/teams/[team_id]/members` from taking `id` to `user_id`.
        * Endpoint was unused so the API change is considered non-breaking.
    * Add `account_type` and `account_url` field in `/api/v1/scoreboard`
    * Separate `/api/v1/[users,teams]/[me,id]/[solves,fails,awards]` into seperate API endpoints
    * Clear standings cache after award creation/deletion
    
    **Exports**
    * Temporarily disable foreign keys in MySQL, MariaDB, and Postgres during `import_ctf()`
    * Add `cache_timeout` parameter to `send_file`response in `/admin/export` to prevent the browser from caching the export
    
    **Tests**
    * Fix score changing test helpers to clear standings cache when generating a score changing row

    ==================
    
    **General**
    * Fix freeze time regressions in 2.x
        * Make `/api/v1/[users,teams]/[me]/[solves,fails,awards]` endpoints load as admin so users can see their solves after freeze
        * Make `/api/v1/challenges/[id]/solves` only show solves before freeze time
            * Add the `?preview=true` GET parameter for admins to preview challenges solves as a user
    * Team join attempts are now ratelimited
    
    **Tests**
    * More linting and autoformatting rules
        * Format Javascript and CSS files with `prettier`: `prettier --write 'CTFd/themes/**/*'`
        * Format Python with `black`: `black CTFd` and `black tests`
        * `make lint` and thus Travis now include the above commands as lint checks
    * Travis now uses xenial instead of trusty.

    * Fix rate-limiting of flag submission when using team mode
    * Fixes some modal close buttons not working in the admin panel
    * Fixes `populate.py` to assign captains to teams.
    
    **Models**
    * Added `Challenges.flags` relationship and moved the `Flags.challenge` relationship to a backref on Challenges
    * Added `ondelete='CASCADE'` to most ForeignKeys in models allowing for deletions to remove associated data
        * `Hints` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
        * `Tags` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
        * `Flags` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
        * `ChallengeFiles` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
            * Deletion of the file itself is not handled by the model/database
        * `Awards` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
        * `Unlocks` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
        * `Tracking` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
        * `Teams.captain_id` should be set to NULL when the captain user is deleted
    
    **Exports**

        * MariaDB outputs strings instead of JSON for its JSON type so the export serializer will attempt to cast output JSON strings to JSON objects
    
    **Deployment**
    * Run as root when using docker-compose

    challenge update modal is now replaceable (#236)
    
    * challenge update modal is now replaceable
    
    By defining
    * [type]-challenge-update.hbs
    * [type]-challenge-modals.hbs
    * [type]-challenge-update.js
    
    in the /static/admin/js/templates/challenges/[type] folder the
    challenge update modal will be defined for any challenges of
    the given type. This allows for essentially full customizability
    of how you will edit custom challenge types in the admin UI.
    
    The reason for having two files, *update.hbs and *modals.hbs, is
    that *update.hbs defines the body for the main challenge update
    modal, while *modals.hbs defines any additional modals which will be
    used within the main modal
    
    There is one function which is required in *update.js is
    `openchal(id)` which will be passed the id of the challenge to be
    edited and should open the modal as well as load any needed data
    
    * fixed multi-modal issues
    
    Issues were coming from two sources:
    * I had placed the modals in an indirect relationship in the DOM
      tree. They need to be siblings I now see
    * There was double counting of modals within multi-modal.js. This
      only started to appear with the dynamically loaded modals. I
      fixed the script to accurately count modals each time

    Removing functionality from the update keys button
    
    This makes the button do nothing but ultimately the issue is that the
    buttons should automatically update the database through AJAX or
    similar. This is a temporary fix so the Keys modal isn’t an outlier in
    design and doesn’t cause an error.

    Pin Ubuntu version and follow Dockerfile best practices (#218)
    
    Docker provides some useful resources for Ubuntu as a base image
    and installing software via apt-get:
    
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#apt-get
    
    It's also useful to pin the Ubuntu version to 16.04 so we have a good
    idea of what OS we're using in the image. To that end, I think we can
    also avoid performing an upgrade so we can even further control which
    versions of software we're using. If we do an upgrade then you'll have
    different versions of software depending on when you build the image.

    Merging PR #206 into master (#215)
    
    * Extracting key checking logic to make it more extensible

    * Adding logging access and errors to Dockerfile

    * Fix exception on cofirmation screen (#202)
    
    When a user attempts to confirm an e-mail address, an exception is thrown because the db session is closed prior to logging.
    
    The line db.session.close() has to move after the logging, otherwise the team parameters from the orm object are discarded and an exception is thrown.
    
    Closing the session after logging, fixes the issue.

    Fix deleting wrong keys from admin panel (#151)
    
    * Fix deleting wrong keys from admin panel
    
    - Fixed wrong_keys.html template using WrongKeys.team instead of
      WrongKeys.teamid
    - Added the id of the wrong key to the wrong_keys.html template entries
    - Changed /admin/wrong_keys to only take the key id instead of team and
      challenge id, to allow deleting the intended key when a team has more
      than one wrong key for a challenge. (Previously it would delete only
      the first wrong key entry for that challenge)
    
    * Have delete_wrong_key use first_or_404
    
    - Switched first() for first_or_404()
    - Changed javascript variable to use underscores instead of camelCase
    
    * Fixing other endpoints which use the deletion interface

    Preventing unnecessary requests

commit 2972cf506d4fe94ad265d198b30fa666ea7b40c6
Author: Blake Burkhart <bburky@bburky.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 7 22:11:31 2015 -0600

    Optionally allow unregistered users to view challenges
    
    Add a Config entry `view_challenges_unregistered` to indicate whether
    unregistered users can view challenges. Add the setting to the admin config
    page.
    
    Add can_view_challenges() to utils to test if a user is either authed, or the
    configuration allow unauthenticated users to view the challenges.
    
    Return a HTTP 401 Unauthorized error when the /chals/solves API can't provide
    results for an unauthenticated user. This is needed because the client side
    code in `chalboard.js` doesn't know if it's logged in or not and requests this
    anyway. (And AJAX doesn't handle redirects very well.) Alternately the client
    could actually know if they're logged in and not make needless API calls.
    
    When an unregistered user attempts to submit a flag, it will also fail. The
    user will be redirected to a login page.
