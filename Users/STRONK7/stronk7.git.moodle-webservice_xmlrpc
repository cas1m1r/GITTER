    Enable all GHA, now that the removal from core is upstream
    
    Till now we were executing against the development branch, that
    was the only one with the protocol removed from core.
    
    As of 20221108 roll, the plugin is now effectively removed
    from core, upstream, and we can enable all tests and switch
    them to use upstream branches.

    switch to master once the removal has happened upstream.

    MDL-73352 phpunit: lib_test and locallib_test testcase names
    
    All lib_test and locallib_test classes:
    
    - Namespaced with component (and API whenever makes sense).
    - Fixed incorrect use statements with leading backslash.
    - Changed code to point to global scope when needed or add new uses.
    - All them passing individually.
    - Complete runs passing too.
    
    Special mention to tests under login/tests:
    
    1) The core_login component doesn't exist.
    2) But login/tests are allowed because there is a suite pointing to it (phpunit.xml).
    3) So, the only possible namespace for them is "core".
    4) And to avoid problems with other core testcases (under lib/tests)
       they have been renamed to have login_xxxx as prefix.

    MDL-71583 versions: Add all the missing full-stops to version/requires
    
    It seems that the new phpcs3 checker is now controlling those
    line comments that previously were ignored.
    
    This commit just looks for all the cases and bulk-add
    them when needed. The bash script (mac) used to add all them is:
    
    while read -r line; do
        arr=(${line//:/ })
        if [[ -n ${arr[0]} ]] && [[ -n ${arr[1]} ]]; then
            echo "  file ${arr[0]}, line ${arr[1]}"
            sed -i "${arr[1]}s/\$/\./" ${arr[0]}
        fi
    done < <(find . -name version.php | xargs ag --nomultiline '>(version|requires) *=.*//.*[^;\.]$')

    MDL-71036 phpunit: Coding style changes, 99% whitespace only
    
    I've gone over a few of the mofified files (those
    which were showing warnings and errors to CiBoT. Some of them
    have been fixed completely, while others only have fixed
    for the lines belonging to this issue (lib/tests/moodlelib_test.php)
    for example.

    MDL-71036 phpunit: Mock->setMethods() silently deprecated
    
    The current ->setMethods() has been silently (won't emit any
    warning) in PHPUnit 9. And will stop working (current plans)
    in PHPUnit 10.
    
    Basically the now deprecated method has been split into:
    
    - onlyMethods(): To point to existing methods in the mocked artifact.
    - addMethods(): To point to non existing (yet) methods in the mocked
      artifact.
    
    In practice that means that all our current setMethods() calls can be
    converted to onlyMethods() (existing) and done. The addMethods() is
    mostly useful on development phases, not final testing.
    
    Finally note that <null> isn't accepted anymore as parameter to
    double all the methods. Instead empty array [] must be used.

    MDL-67673 phpunit: Fix the return type of template methods
    
    All the setup/teardown/pre/post/conditions template methods
    now are required to return void. This was warned with phpunit 7
    and now is enforced.
    
    At the same time, fix a few wrong function names,
    provider data and param types, return statements...

    MDL-69475 versions: bump all versions and requires in master
    
    version = 2021052500 release version
    requires= 2021052500 same than version
    
    Why 20210525? (25th May 2021) ?
    
    Because master is going to be Moodle 4.0, to be released
    on November 2021. And, until then, we are going to have
    a couple of "intermediate" releases:
    
    - Moodle 3.10 to be released 9th November 2020. (2020110900)
    
      This version will be using versions from today to 2020110900
      (once it's released the YYYYMMDD part stops advancing).
    
    - Moodle 3.11 to be released 10th May 2021. (2021051000)
    
      This version will be using versions from 3.10 release to 2021051000
      (once it's released the YYYYMMDD part stops advancing).
    
    That means that all versions from today to 2021051000 are going
    to be used by those 2 "intermediate" releases (3.10 and 3.11).
    
    And we cannot use them in master, because it's forbidden to have
    any overlapping of versions between branches (or different upgrade
    paths will fail).
    
    So, get that 2021051000, let's add it a couple of weeks to cover
    the on-sync period (or a 2 weeks delay max!) and, the first version
    that master can "own" in exclusive (without any overlap) is, exactly,
    25th May 2021, hence our 20210525.

    Without this, the xmlrpc_decode_request() call on the server side may
    lead to wrongly decoded non-ascii characters.

    MDL-15252 Re-committing all English strings exported from AMOS
    
    From now on, all English strings use the new syntax. They are not
    eval()'ed any more and the only valid placeholders are {$a} and
    {$a->foobar}. No extra quotes escaping, dollar sign escaping and putting
    double percent signs.
    
    The modified files were exported from AMOS database repository in the
    new syntax and were re-ordered by stringid. Standard GNU/GPL and PHPdoc
    blocks are added. Where there was no copyright note so far, I added the
    default one with Martin Dougiamas as the copyright holder.
    
    Live long and prosper.
