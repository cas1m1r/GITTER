    Old ones have been archived, so moving away from them. The picked

    Also, fix an existing typo (sop => stop).

    Bump GHA environment to use Ubuntu 22.04
    
    Since some time ago, GH is warning us that the Ubuntu 18.04
    environment is deprecated:
    
    "The ubuntu-18.04 environment is deprecated, consider switching to
    ubuntu-20.04(ubuntu-latest), or ubuntu-22.04 instead...."
    
    Hence, we are bumping here, to be able to cerify if everything
    continues working ok.
    
    The changes cover own scripts, templates and guides. All them
    now pointing to Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy).

Date:   Sun Jul 17 20:37:41 2022 +0200

    Bump self-tests to 4.1 requirements
    
    Trivial for GHA, just change of images to postgres:12, but...
    
    Travis changed the PostgreSQL package for version 11 and up so, instead of
    using the "postgres" user it now uses the "travis" one. And the port is
    5433 instead of 5432. We use the existence of the PGVER environmental
    variable to decide which defaults to use.
    
    More yet, the connection via "localhost" (local net) now requires login and
    password, it used to be trust/peer auth mode (not requiring password). If we want to
    keep localhost (+ port) working, then we need to edit the  pg_hba.conf file
    to trust/peer the local connections and then restart the database.
    
    So, at the end, we are going to use socket connections (host = '')
    that is perfectly ok for Travis (non dockered database). Only if they
    haven't been configured another way manually (user, host, port).

    Changes to guarantee that --version works always
    
    With this change:
    
    1) moodle-plugin-ci.phar will continue working the same,
       with `--version` always returning the correct (git describe)
       version used to build the phar.
    2) bin/moodle-plugin-ci will also show the correct (git describe)
       version, when it's run from a git directory. If not git is detected
       the version specified in `MOODLE_PLUGIN_CI_VERSION` will be used.
    
    Plus:
    
    - In order to ensure that the `MOODLE_PLUGIN_CI_VERSION` is updated
      on every release a new check has been added to `make validate`.
      It will compare the latest version documented in the `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
      file with the version in the `bin/moodle-plugin-ci` file.
    - Release docs have been amended to remember to update the version
      in `bin/moodle-plugin-ci` when making a release.
    
    Fixes #169

commit f1c736f17db9dbad199f31769932fd06e17995f6

    Move phpcs command from library mode to binary mode
    
    Until now we were using the phpcs in "library mode", i.e.
    like it was a library and using its API to run it within
    PHP. That had a few advantages but some problems, having
    to "cheat" here and there to get everything working.
    
    More noticeably, the include-paths and other details
    were conflicting badly with the, now isolated and installed
    by composer moodle-cs standard, and the phpcs.xml files now
    present in core.
    
    So this commit just changes that "unsupported" library use
    by a more natural use as binary, so we just run it from shell,
    with proper CLI options and so on.
    
    The only detail a little bit tricky is that now, in order to
    continue supporting the max-warnings option in moodle-plugin-ci,
    instead of getting the number of errors and warnings from the API,
    we have to generate the json report and extract totals information
    from there. Anyway, it seems to be stable enough. Covered with tests.

    Merge pull request #166 from stronk7/better_code_coverage
    
    Use pcov => xdebug => phpdbg for phpunit code coverage

commit a0bec997edc7850640d7e96921964860c2d15bcc
Author: Eloy Lafuente (stronk7) <stronk7@moodle.org>
Date:   Sun Apr 24 18:46:06 2022 +0200

    Use pcov => xdebug => phpdbg for phpunit code coverage
    
    Right now we are only using phpdbg for phpunit code coverage. And
    it's causing some problems with latest (8.0, 8.1) php versions.
    
    Also, since phpunit 8, its code coverage tool supports pcov, that
    is the lighter and better alternative. And then, xdebug running
    in coverage mode has become way better in recent versions.
    
    So, with this patch applied, moodle-plugin-ci will look for the
    "best" code coverage alternative (pcov => xdebug => phpdbg) in
    every run.
    
    This guarantees that existing automations, not having pcov or
    xdebug available will continue fall-backing to phpdbg. But if
    any of the 2 extensions are available, we'll be using them.
    
    No matter of the above (fully automatic), it's also possible
    to configure the desired code coverage tool with 3 new options,
    in case it's needed to force any:
      - coverage-pcov
      - coverage-xdebug
      - coverage-phpdbg
    
    Added support to the '--verbose' option to be passed to phpunit
    (useful to debug options or see details about skipped tests).
    
    Includes modifications to both GHA docs and template to show the new options.
    
    And, also, changes to own CI tests to have both pcov and xdebug used
    all the time.

    moodle-plugin-ci is not ready for this yet. We need to move
    from current use of local_codechecker to composer + moodle-cs
    before being able to allow these new .phpcs.xml files in core.
    
    So, for now, we are just deleting it as part of the tool
    installation. This will be revisited when moving to the
    new approach commented above.

commit 8b6761a97e27eab5b6e1eac6d4800f7dfb716930
Author: Eloy Lafuente (stronk7) <stronk7@moodle.org>
Date:   Sat Feb 26 17:56:10 2022 +0100

    Rebuild AMD test expectations using the new minify/rollup
    
    In MDL-73915 NodeJS was bumped to 16 LTS and also the
    minify system was modernized, explicitly removing support for IE.
    
    That has caused the resulting built AMD files to be different,
    so we have to put here the new versions in order to get self
    tests passing.
    
    Note that the 4.0 and up minified versions are different from
    the previous ones, and, although they are interchangeable, we
    only can assert one of them here. So we go with the 4.0 and up,
    explicitly disabling the check for older branches (they are sort
    of past, no matter they are still supported).
    
    Also, we have already added as valid the MOODLE_400_STABLE branch
    in the GHA workflow, so we won't need to add it in some weeks when the
    branch is created (on release).

    Avoid forks to perform releases when they receive tags
    
    Before this, forks getting the tags pushed were performing
    own releases of moodle-plugin-ci. Let's run that job only
    for the root "moodlehq" one.

    Disable xdebug and pcov from self (validate) tests
    
    We already were doing that in self (ci) tests and
    also in recommended gha.dist.yml for plugins.
    
    But for some reason (miss I imagine) we left this
    validate test still installing both xdebug and then
    using phpdbg for collecting coverage information.
    
    And, as of today, it has started to crash (curiously,
    it was not crashing earlier):
    
    https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/actions/runs/1572798313
    
    So, doing things properly, just disable any other covergae
    extension because we use phpdbg.

    Remove the 'header_comment' rule from php-cs-fixer
    
    It was enforcing us to keep the Blackboard header for all files
    when new ones shouldn't be subject to that copyright notice.
    
    For the records, the new file comment should be like:
    
    ```
    <?php
    
    // This file is part of the Moodle Plugin CI package.
    //

    Revamped phpunit code coverage analysis
    
    - Whenever a tests/coverage.php file is filter, don't apply
      code coverage defaults any more. That file is used by phpunit
      init to properly configure the desired coverage. This rule
      only applies when running tests against Moodle 3.7 and up.
    - Whenever we are using PHPUnit 9.5 and up, use the new coverage
      syntax where <filter><whitelist> became <coverage><include>. This
      rule only applies when running tests against Moodle 3.11 and up.
    - Covered with tests.
    
    Closes #93 and #120

    Bump to PHPUnit 6.5.x
    
    While this is also a very outdated PHPUnit version, it aligns
    better with current PHP 7.0 min requirement for the whole
    moodle-plugin-ci.
    
    Also, better go gradually moving up so transitions to recent
    versions 7.x, 8.x, 9.x... are simpler, whenever we decide to
    raise moodle-plugin-ci PHP required version.

Date:   Wed May 12 18:20:46 2021 +0200

    Update project dependencies
    
    Most noticeble one being local_moodlecheck v1.0.7 that
    comes with PHP8 specific fixes.
    
    Also updated nikic/php-parser to newer version, able
    to run with any >= 7.0 PHP version (8.0 included) and
    parse every PHP version (5.x to 8.0).
    
    Changes to the php-parser required some changes in code:
    
    - Look for assignments inside extra Expression element.
    - Add 3 psalm cases to baseline, about some casts (the
      objects have the _toString() method, but psalm isn't
      aware).
    
    (details @ https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/blob/master/UPGRADE-4.0.md)
    
    Finally, so changes because of phpmd bump were also required.

    The most important it the push one, because anybody
    contributing to mooodle-plugin-ci wont get their
    dev/proposal branches tested. Only if they work on
    master, they will.
    
    About pull requests, this is less critical, as far as
    master is out only current branch. But tomorrow we may
    rename it, or create new upstream branches, so there
    isn't anything wrong opening the doors to that now.

    Bump to codechecker/codenisffer 3.0
    
    Changes in commands are important because all the old CLI machinery
    in phpcs 3.0 has been removed. There were some different solutions
    for this:
    
    - start using the bin/phpcs binary (exec) and forget.
    - create a custom runner/reporter like we did in local_codechecker.
    - use exclusively the new phpcs 3.0 classes to get it done.
    
    While I was really tempted to re-use the local_codechecker custom
    runner / reporter, finally I went the pure phpcs classes way to
    avoid creating any dependency on local_codechecker (apart from the
    standard).
    
    Unit tests have been slightly improved to better assert that all the
    expected elements in the output are there.
    
    Finally, we have had to instruct phpcs where the PHPCompatibility
    standard is because, when running from PHAR, the CodeSniffer.conf
    file bundled is not read and it's expected to be in real filesystem.
    This was causing codechecher not to work from PHAR, so we are now
    configuring it from the commands (Checker and Fixer).

    Don't install grunt globally. Instead run it with npx
    
    This is necessary (or at least helpful) for running on github actions.

    Check for a yui/src directory when running the Grunt YUI task
    
    This commit solves an issue in some repositories where the following
    message is shown:
    
        Unable to find local grunt
    
    This message is a little confusing because the Grunt uses both a global,
    and a local copy of the Grunt executable. The global variant comes from
    the `npm install grunt-cli` Installation task, whilst the local variant
    is a dependency of Moodle.
    
    The message actually occurs when the global executable is unable to find
    the local variant from the current working directory.
    
    To give an example, given the following directory:
    
        /home/travis/build/moodle/local/chatlogs/yui/src
    
    Grunt will check each of the parent directories until it finds a
    `Gruntfile.js` and/or relevant `node_modules/.bin/grunt` executable, i.e.:
    
        /home/travis/build/moodle/local/chatlogs/yui/src
        /home/travis/build/moodle/local/chatlogs/yui
        /home/travis/build/moodle/local/chatlogs
        /home/travis/build/moodle/local
        /home/travis/build/moodle
        /home/travis/build
        /home/travis
        /home
        /
    
    If none is found then the "Unable to find local grunt" message is then
    shown.
    
    In the issue where this fault was detected, the plugin does have a `yui`
    directory, but it uses the legacy module structure where the YUI module
    is placed directly into the directory, and not within a Shifted module
    structure. That is to say that the following is the actual directory
    structure of the plugin:
    
    ```
    └── yui
        ├── jabberaliases
        │   └── jabberaliases.js
        └── keyboard
            └── keyboard.js
    ```
    
    This is a perfectly valid YUI structure, but Grunt is unaware of it, and
    its use has not been recommended for many years. There is no `src`
    directory present, and each module is just in it's own directory outside
    of the src structure.
    
    The Grunt Command was configured to perform the following when
    processing a `yui` task:
    
    ```
    case 'yui':
        $yuiDir = $this->plugin->directory.'/yui';
        if (!is_dir($yuiDir)) {
            return null;
        }
    
        return new GruntTaskModel($task, $yuiDir.'/src', 'yui/build');
    ```
    
    Essentially it assumes that if the `yui` directory exists then the task
    should pass a workingDirectory for `yui/src`.
    
    In this case there is no yui/src directory, but the full path is passed
    as a working directory to the `ProcessBuilder`.  The ProcessBuilder does
    not care that the directory does not exist (presumably because it may
    not exist during build, but may do prior to execution), but the result
    is that `grunt` is called with a non-existent working directory.
    
    It is not possible to traverse anywhere where the working directory does
    not exist, and so the local Grunt cannot be found.
    
    The solution here is to always look for `yui/src` within the plugin
    directory.
    
    Grunt is not aware of the older-style directories and does not perform
    any checks on those so there is no loss of functionality.

    Bump symfony dep injection component to ^3.4
    
    That makes a number of components to be also updated to 3.4.x
    and requires php >7.0.8 (instead of 7.0.0).
    
    Also updated psalm-baseline.xml to ignore 'node-version' potential
    wrong assignment values.
    
    Note I've not run --update-baseline because it comes with other
    changes that I don't want to modify now (removing some options).
    I leave that for the experts because I'm not sure how the baseline
    is decided and which part is automatic or manual.

    Fix the commit reference of the latest local_moodlecheck plugin
    
    The travis-ci is still using the old version of the local_moodlecheck
    plugin. As a result, I am seeing some false failures such as "Invalid
    inline phpdocs tag @see found" which I am not getting when using the
    latest version locally.
    
    I suspect that the commit c006b90 only raised the "version" without also
    setting the right "reference".

    Once we get 35, 37, 38 out of support we'll be able to remove
    that exceptional exit code handling (that I've not verified,
    to be honest).

    Add --node-version parameter to install step.
    
    The option allows to override default Node.js version (which is picked
    from .nvmrc) by providing --node-version parameter or defining
    `NODE_VERSION` env variable. The value of this parameter should be
    compatible with `nvm install` command, e.g. `v8.9`, `8.9.0`,
    `lts/erbium`. Basically, assume param value is added to .nvmrc and nvm
    should be able to consume it while running `nvm install && nvm use`.

    Use .nvmrc for picking the right version of Node.js.
    
    Since Moodle 3.5 there is .nvmrc file at the top directory specifying
    Node.js (npm) version Node Package Manager (nvm) should install.
    
    We can use this to initialise Node.js environment as part of install
    process, so that user would not need to worry about having correct
    version of Node in before_install step.

    Bump local_codechecker to 2.9.6, just released.
    
    Note that these changes, and also the previous #111 are for nothing
    unless packagist is refreshed with a new release of moodle-plugin-ci.
    
    Without that everybody continues getting old outdated, components,
    like local_codechecker 2.9.3, for example, that is the one corresponding
    to the latest version (2.5.0) released @ packagist of moodle-plugin-ci.
    
    Current one is really aging (Feb 2019)!
    
    Link: https://packagist.org/packages/blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci
    
    And only solution for developers is to use custom repositories and other
    non-ideal tricks to get the actual versions installed.

    Attempt to fix race conditions in parallel Moodle script executions

    a directory did not exist and then fail creating it because
    it already exists.  Likely was created in a parallel process.

    Workaround for stalling builds on Travis CI
    
    Looks like if you leave background processes running
    then Travis fails to detect when your build has
    stopped running.
    
    Only background processes are servers for Behat.
    Instead of running them in the background, instead
    spin them up on demand to ensure they are killed
    once done.
    
    Note: I still see PHP running, but seems to be OK.

    Avoid using static cache in core_component
    
    When installing multiple plugins, core_component's
    static cache becomes stale.  This is bad when installing
    a parent plugin, then a sub-plugin.  Use reflection
    to gain access to the un-cached method we need.

    Avoid race condition with curl and starting Selenium
    
    Just noticed that the selenium.jar file is being downloaded
    and being used nearly at the same exact time.  Unsure how
    it didn't break before, but avoid problems by first downloading
    the file and then starting the server after.

    Use moodlerooms/moodle-coding-standard
    
    The repositories section of the composer.json is
    only allowed for root level projects.  This would
    prevent this project from being installed globally
    or as a dependency.  Created
    moodlerooms/moodle-coding-standard which
    is just a container for the Moodle coding standards.

    Tricking composer
    
    Adding dev-master broke simple things like
    composer update.  Tricking composer to think
    v2.3.2 is master in moodlehq/codechecker.
    
    When v2.3.3 is released with our required fix,
    then this trick can be reverted to using tags
    again.

    Rewrite to remove Phing
    
    Phing had limitations with testing edge cases
    and supporting extra use cases.  Switching
    the project to a CLI application to increase
    test coverage and flexibility.
    
    Other changes:
    * Added Composer cache to Travis files.
    * Switched to using ENV to communicate important bits.
    * Standardized output of commands (least the starting of them).
    * Install is must less verbose by default (nice progress bar)
    * Project can now be globally installed via Composer
    * Renamed bin/helper to bin/moodle-plugin-ci
    * Added lots of tests
    * Added CONTRIBUTING.md
    * Broke up README.md into pages in doc/

    Remove other install options
    
    After some consideration, the default Install
    target should sufficiently the use cases that
    the other install options covered.  This is due
    to the improved detection of Behat and
    PHPUnit tests in the plugin.
    
    Also fixed some comments.

    Move all flags to build.properties file
    
    Instead of creating various files and a
    plugin.properties file, create a single
    build.properties file and write properties
    to it during install.  Then script.xml can
    read the properties and not have to do
    anything odd.

    Big change to make .travis.yml completely generic
    
    Created a new PHP CLI commands to do two things:
    * Install the plugin into Moodle.
    * Generate a Phing property file with info about the plugin.
    
    This means we no longer have to define things about
    the plugin in the .travis.yml file.  Winning!
