commit 9a5acf921943364e559328b5efb80aab71e79d80
Author: Eloy Lafuente (stronk7) <stronk7@moodle.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 13 19:16:54 2022 +0200

    Add extra check for cases where no MDL blockers are found
    
    For example in MDL-69655 there was a blocker, but it was
    a MDLSITE one, and, by default, that was leading to a
    lowered priority, when it shouldn't.
    
    Now we skip those issues, when blockers are not MDL.

    Don't move the priory of CLR issues back to 0 ever
    
    That way the job will be 100% balanced with the job
    setting the priority to 1 automatically for all them.

    Clean the "current in integration" field on reopen
    
    Note this is done automatically by mv_reopened_out_from_current,
    hourly, but if we can do it now for these automatic reopens, better.
    (that saves one notification in the Tracker)

    Remove the jshint utility and associated tests
    
    With this we completely remove the special npm uses
    in the tests, yay! Everything should be handled by
    local_ci itself now, installing the nodejs when needed.
    
    Also, move a few more tests (old, mainly) to match the
    expectations now that jshint is out. Bumping them to
    39_STABLE when possible (if they aren't explicitly old).

    Fix the reopen timing and notification
    
    Because the reminder, sent after 5 days (for example) makes
    a fake transition (from WfF to WfF) we need to account separately
    for issues without changes:
        - Since sent to WfT  (7 days, for example) for issues that weren't reminded (notification = 2)
        - Since remind happened (2 days, for example) for issues that were reminded (notification = 3)

    Pity search is case-insensitive and CRUD are sensitive. Only

    Add renamed classes following MDL-75716
    
    In MDL-75716, unit test class names were updated to match file names. As
    a result the parent class for a couple of tests was changed and must be
    added to the list of known parent classes.
    
    The old location is not removed as they may still be legitimately used
    in older versions of Moodle.

    Calculate last test in a file differently
    
    Recent changes in bats-core, in order to implement setup and
    teardown facilities, have changed how internal test names work.
    
    https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core/issues/39 (and others)
    
    Because if this we cannot use those test names to detect
    the last test in a file anymore.
    
    So we need to rely exclusively on BATS_TEST_NUMBER, that
    continues working ok.
    
    That's all we do here and it should make the tests to be back to pass.

    Move from days to hours for timing better resolution
    
    We need to use hours instead of days, because the "AFTER -5d" is not accurate enough. In
    practice it accounts for 4.5 days, or something like that, hence the actions are happening
    some hours before they should. So, using hours (days * 24) to get more accurate results.

    MDLSITE-6612 Manage the issues awaiting for feedback
    
    This controls the flow of issues waiting for feedback (WfF), both
    Integration (IR) and Component Leads Review (CLR). Performing
    the following actions:
    
    A) Initial notification to all issues sent to WfF, explaining
       which the expectations are.
    B) After a (configurable) number of days under WfF, reopen the issue
       and notify it.
    C) Optional. After a (configurable) number of days under WfF,
       remind in the issue about the remaining days and expectations.
    
    Note the solution heavily rely on the "Waiting for Feedback Notifications"
    field specifically created for this job and also includes workflow
    modifications. For more details, visit the issue (MDLSITE-6612).

    MDLSITE-6709 Avoid running the backup & external check for plugin runs
    
    As far as we don't check the plugins incrementally (commit by commit)
    like we do for normal MDL issues by CiBoT or PRs by moodle-plugin-ci,
    this check is not useful for checks coming from the plugins database
    (because they are just standard moodle branches + 1 unique commit
    with all the plugin source code).
    
    So we are disabling this check to be run when the source branches
    are PLUGIN-xxx ones (we do the same for the commit check already).
    
    Covered with tests.
    
    PS: Also, delete old TODO comment that should have been deleted
    few weeks ago, when another PR was merged.

    All jobs moving issues to current integration must set clr = no
    
    All the issues arriving to current integration must have
    the "Component Lead Review" field set to no, no matter if
    the move is done by any of the queue managers or the bulk-move
    that is executed on freeze day.
    
    If they are kept empty / not set, that affects pickers because
    one of the sorting criteria is that field.
    
    Technically, all the places that are setting:
    
    customfield_10211:Yes (Currently in integration = Yes)
    
    Must, unconditionally, set:
    
    customfield_15810:No (Component Lead Review = No)
    
    That's exactly what this change does.

    Create the phpunit.xml file not requiring database or real site
    
    In order to create the phpunit.xml file, PHPUnit requires a
    real database / site to be able to do its job. But here we are
    @ CIs and don't want to spend resources and time doing the
    whole phpunit boostrap (database connection, composer stuff...).
    
    So this CLI just workarounds all those requirements and straight
    calls to phpunit_util::build_config_file() that is able to
    do all the work with just a few includes.
    
    This uses the also, moodle-less load_core_component_from_moodle()
    in order to get all the components loaded.

    After release, first held issue, then keep the queue fed
    
    We have just swapped the steps, because, after release (while on-sync)
    we were first moving the issues to current and later looking for
    new improvements and features to be held (and none was being found,
    obviously because they had been moved).
    
    So this change ensures that, after release (it was correct before
    release). We first held improvements and new features (B1a) and
    only then consider the remaining issues to keep the current
    integration fed (B1b).

    Change the query used to count reopened issues
    
    Previously it was looking for FROM...TO transitions but it's
    possible that the transition happens from other statuses.
    
    So, now, we count ANY issue that was under integration in process,
    waiting for feedback or testing failed statuses and has been reopened.
    
    Both conditions since the last time a roll happened, of course (when
    the gates were open to continue integrating).

    on every CiBoT execution.
    
    Hence, removing it from CiBoT (remote_branch_checker) and
    associated tests. But keeping the shell script and its own
    tests, in case they are useful for anybody.
    
    Also, added TODO about the possibility of adding a GHA
    checker (a simple https request can tell us if actions are
    enabled for a repo), but not sure if it's worth it as far
    as 99% of people have them enabled.

    Avoid blocked issues to "consume" to be moved seats
    
    Before the patch, every blocked issue was being accounted
    as a move (because before we implemented the blocked detectors
    all issues were, unconditionally, moved).
    
    Now, we account to really moved issues in another ($moved)
    variable and allow the process to continue until we have
    really moved $movemax issues.
    
    This way, blocked issues (or any other condition/check) that
    we may want to introduce in the future won't affect the outcome
    of moving up to $movemax issues.

    Pass the complete list of components to phpcs

    Pass the complete list of components to phpcs
    
    Normally, phpcs itself is able to get all the components
    installed in a given dir root (it just loads them using
    standard core_component class).
    
    But, for performance reasons, with CiBoT, we delete all
    files from dir root but those being part of the patchest
    being analysed (and a few exceptions like version.php, grunt...).
    
    That means that it's unable to load core_component or find all
    the components available in a site.
    
    But that's ok, because one of the first things that the remote
    branch checker already does (before deleting files), is to, always,
    calculate all the valid components and save them to the
    /work/valid_components.txt file.
    
    And then, codechecker can use the new config setting
    "moodleComponentsListPath" to load exactly that file. See
    https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker/pull/160
    for more information about that feature.
    
    Covered with tests to verify that it's getting the components
    information properly.

    Always verify if the candidate issues are blocked by others
    
    Previously it only was checked for "blocker" issues (one of
    the conditions to consider the issue important). Now it's checked
    as for all the conditions:
    - mldqa
    - must-fix
    - security
    - blocker
    
    Old behaviour was causing some ping-pong with issues being raised
    and immediately after that, being lowered. Now, they won't be
    raised ever if it's blocked by any unresolved.

    Avoid the normal queues manager to play with blocks/is blocked by issues
    
    The set_integration_priority_to_[zero|one] scripts are in charge of
    controlling the integration priority of both blockers and blocked issues
    (see the scripts for more details), so we don't want the normal queues
    manager to perform any change of priority on them.
    
    Note that this is the only other actually active script playing with
    integration priority (there is also the old delay_awaiting_issues one
    but we don't use it anymore because was replaced by the queue managers).

    Lower the priority of blocked issues
    
    This changes are very similar to the ones used to
    raise priority of blocker issues but, instead, lowers
    the priority of any issue that has unresolved blockers.
    
    Why? Because the blockers always need to be processed earlier
    (and will get the priority raised), hence the "blocked" ones
    better get the priority lowered.
    
    I've run the 2 scripts a number of times (raise & lower) and
    no ping-pong effect is possible within them, those raised remain
    raised and those lowered remain lowered.
    
    (unless something changes in the issues, of course, say because
    some of the blockers are resolved or whatever)
    
    After this, there will be another commit to make to the queues
    managers also aware of the blocking status, so they won't be
    undoing (raising) the priority of issues lowered by this job.
    
    Also note that a few small changes have been applied to the
    sister set_integration_priority_to_one.sh script to better
    inform in console about the decisions taken. Maybe we'll end
    also adding a restricted comment in the issue to know which
    script was in charge of deciding the change of priority (but
    it's not strictly needed now).

    Now, all the issues that are blockers (blocks link type) to others and don't have

    priority also raised to 1.
    
    Done with pure JiraCLI, to allow it to work against any Jira server (we
    won't be able to use some plugin that provides the same in an easier
    way).
    
    This has been already executed a number of times and seems to be working
    correctly. Like 10-12 issues have got their priority raised. All them
    non-blocked blockers.
    
    Note that another follow-up will follow soon, about to lower the
    priority of any issue that is blocked.

    Prevent scripts against some buggy JAVA en_AU locales
    
    From CLDR29 to CLDR33, the month and day names for en_AU were broken, incorrectly
    adding a dot (.) after the day and month names. And it was fixed in CLDR34 . So I imagine
    that java versions >=9 (when they changed from own locales to CLDR) that are using those CLDR
    versions… are doomed (that for sure includes Java10).
    
    Alternatively, there is the following switch:
    
    -Djava.locale.providers=COMPAT, CLDR
    
    to make Java own locales to be used instead of CLDR ones.
    
    But as far as en_AU is already fixed in actual versions, we are simply
    removing those incorrect dots fom the date fetched with Jira CLI and
    done.

    Add some exceptions within tool/brickfield
    
    All the cases are sort of test/fixture files and license. So maybe
    it's not crazy to review them and, if some can be cleaned, proceed.
    
    So https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-71532 has been created
    about that. Once fixed, surely we'll be able to remove some
    of the exceptions being added here.

    Allow to decide the target for the ToBiC comments
    
    Right now, all the comments in the criteria are
    harcoded to Integrators.
    
    This change allow you to pick any other role in the project
    with blank meaning visible to all.
    
    The jobs @ ci.moodle.org has been already modified to support
    this new parameter that will be configurable when any of the
    jobs there are executed manually. By default, they continue
    restricting to Integrators, until we decide to open them.

    SKIPped if the integration is not setup. A warning is still used if
    travis-ci.org is configured but not travis-ci.com.

    Reset the ismasteronly flag for every issue being checked
    
    Today the first Moodle 4.0 only issue has landed, hence it
    has got the first master-only label.
    
    Problem is that such label was not being reset properly in the
    loop and once set... it was applied to all subsequent issues.
    
    By moving it to within the loop, we ensure it has the
    correct default (empty/false) for every issue (unless
    it's detected to be present).

    Bump travis and related tests to work with php73
    
    Various tests do need php73 that is the minimum requirement
    to 311_STABLE and master (4.0). So we bump travis to use it
    and also related tests, removing old branches not suporting
    that php version.
    
    Note this also includes the change from original bats to
    new bats-core fork (old was abandoned).
    
    Finally, set innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0 and, also,
    move MySQL to tmpfs to get some speed gains allowing
    us to workaround random travis timeout problems (in the
    compare_databases tests mainly). We already do this in core.

    In many situations we want to run all behat tests, keeping phpunit apart

    This issue introduces a new behat-all job type that will behave exactly

    Add possibility to exclude selected Mustache files from HTML validation
    
    When developing for the Moodle Mobile App, the Mustache templates may
    contain Ionic3 / Angular specific syntax that itself is not valid HTML.
    The patch adds an option to skip the HTML validation part of the
    Mustache linting.
    
    To ignore HTML validation errors, create a file .mustachelintignore in
    the directory with Mustache templates and define the file name patterns
    for the files to be excluded from HTML validation. PHP function
    fnmatch() is used to search for matches. Lines starting with the hash
    sign are considered as comments.

    Always check for all dev branches if they haven't been verified
    
    If not all the dev branches have been verified while testing
    fix-versions (that's usual when there are stable fix-version
    or multiple dev branches) then we must ensure that:
    
    1) All dev branches have commits belonging to the issue.
    2) If the issue has the "master-only" label other dev branches
       different from master are exempt from the check.
    3) If the issue has the "master-only" label and other dev branches
       different from master have commits, report too.
    4) If the issue has master as fix-version then it must have the
       "master-only" label. This, indirectly, implies that the correct
       fix versions will be always the first one, in case the isse has
       been integrated to multiple dev branches.

    Implement the interval checker to ensure all versions are within limits
    
    Tested against all branches, it seems that we have a couple of
    violations in 35_STABLE and 38_STABLE. Unlikely to cause problems
    but glad the tests detected them.
    
    We are going to enable these checks for 39_STABLE and up, using
    the following allowed version intervals:
    
    3.5: 20180514-20180517 (grrr there is a 2018061801 version!)

    Add support for multiple development branches.
    
    This implements:
    - Allow 3-digit branches where needed.
    - Change some STABLE/master checks to be based on maturity.
    - Initial implementation of the "betweenversions" check (to be
      able to specify an interval of versions allowed in every branch).
    
    TODO: Complete the "betweenversions" implementation and seek and destroy
          all the related TODOs.

    Continuous manage queues (1 of 2)
    
    This script adds some automatisms helping to manage the integration queues:
     - candidates queue: issues awaiting from integration not yet in current.
     - current queue: issues under current integration.
    
    The automatisms are as follow:
     1) Move "important" issues from candidates to current.
     2) Keep the current queue fed with issues when it's under a threshold.
    
    The criteria to consider an issue "important" are:
     1) It must be in the candidates queue, awating for integration.        |
     2) It must not have the integration_held or security_held labels.      | => filter=14000
     3) It must not have the "agreed_to_be_after_release" text in a comment.| => NOT filter = 21366
     4) At least one of this is true:
       a) The issue has a must-fix version.                                 | => filter = 21363
       b) The issue has the mdlqa label.                                    | => labels IN (mdlqa)
       c) The issue priority is critical or higher.                         | => priority IN (Critical, Blocker)
       d) The issue is flagged as security issue.                           | => level IS NOT EMPTY
       e) The issue belongs to some of these components:                    | => component IN (...)
         - Privacy
         - Automated functional tests (behat)
         - Unit tests
    
    This job must be enable only since freeze until release day.
    
    Note this implements only the 1st automatism, another commit will add
    the 2nd one.

    Fix change of behavior in eslint/stylelint (exit when no files)

commit 55440e3a998cddb0cadde9e8929900de8f4b02c2
Author: Eloy Lafuente (stronk7) <stronk7@moodle.org>
Date:   Tue May 12 19:08:12 2020 +0200

    Fix change of behavior in eslint v6.8 and up
    
    Old eslint versions, when there weren't any JS file to inspect
    just exited silently and without error (exit status = 0).
    
    But since eslint v6.8.0, if there aren't JS files, it exits
    with error (exit status = 1). A new option,
    --no-error-on-unmatched-pattern, has been created to provide
    the BC bahavior.
    
    So we need to discern which eslint is being used. Initally I
    did it looking for --version... but it's inexact.
    
    So, surely, the safest way is to verify if the new option exists
    or no (using --help). And decide based on that.
    
    That's exactly what this patch does. I've also added a TODO
    because one everybody is already using nodejs 14 we won't need
    this hack anymore.
    
    Also, added pretty much the same for stylelint, but using the
    --allow-empty-input option.
    
    Finally note that there is another eslint use (within the mustache
    linter) that is not fixed here. It will come in a new PR because
    the fix is different (eslint is executed from within PHP).

    Avoid sourced script to overwite caller $mydir variable
    
    Important, this script is always run sourced from others, so it shouldn't define
    any shell variable also set/used by caller scripts. A clear example is the $mydir
    variable below, that was being set for caller script, leading to strange failures.
    
    In this case it was easy to fix, because this script doesn't use it, so getting rid
    of it was enough. But in general, avoid setting any widely used variable here.

    Automatically follow .nvmrc when available
    
    This enables all jobs using the script (security rebase, prechecker,
    grunt, ... to, automatically use the current node version speficied
    in the .nvmrc file.
    
    This includes:
    - installing nvm if not available ($HOME/.nvm)
    - update nvm to the latest release
    - source nvm
    - install and use the .nvmrc version
    
    Note that, once working, this renders the use of the nvm-wrapper
    jenkins extension futile, as far as it does everything the extension
    was doing previously. But better, because now we can control when
    our moodle directoy is ready and with the correct .nvmrc file.
    
    This will help to issues like MDL-66109, so whenever a node bump
    happens, it's automatically detected and handled by our scripts
    that will bump and use the new node version transparently.
    
    If there is no .nvmrc file, nvm is not sourced, installed or used.
    Assumed that somebody else has already prepared all the stuff.

    Only look for commits sice last roll
    
    Previously we were looking for matching commits at any point in the
    branch. Now we only look for commits since last roll (moodle.git)
    happened.
    
    That will help detecting issues left under current integration that
    have been already rolled, like happened with MDL-66075 for example.
    
    Also, in the case that rolling has just happened, the integrator has
    a grade period of 60 minutes to close the issues. After that time..
    any issue under current integration missing commits will, normally,
    lead to error.

    Tidy the search to verify the status ON old date, not BEFORE
    
    Previously it was only returning issues that never had been
    in 'Waiting for integration review' status, keeping out
    issues thay may have been already under integration.
    
    Now we just look for issues that changed from anything in
    the past date to 'Waiting for integration review'.
    
    Note we cannot use the ideal CHANGED TO ... because there
    are a bunch of transitions that change from waiting to waiting
    and they are returned. We don't want them.
    
    For normal executions at fixed intervals (2h right now) it won't
    make much difference in practice, so all right

    for every branch in the issue.
    
    At Jenkins level we'll be throttling those (DEV) jobs to prevent
    this script to end using all the available workers.
    
    It's important to make the schedulemins parameter to match the
    intervals (in minutes) in the job schedule plan (cron) or some
    issues could be processed twice or skipped.
    
    Finally note that the current criteria includes a extra condition:
    
    AND participants not in (tobic)
    
    So we'll be processing an issue only once. This can be tidied/chaged
    later, but for now it's a basic protection trying to avoid an issue
    going back and forth to consume too much infrastructure resources.
    
    Also note that, for now, we have disabled the Oracle PHPUnit job, just
    to sabe some workers until we have the job controlled and decide that
    we can add more jobs to it.
    
    This job will be launched by the "TR - Bulk pre-launch DEV jobs
    (awaiting_integration)" job that has been already created and is
    waiting for this to land to perform the final configuration and
    schedule it.

    MDLSITE-2892 Now the delayed counter looks for comments by date

commit 0a1b47f64dac237c27ec73831581b15676f4e290

    MDLSITE-2892 Now the delayed counter looks for comments by date
    
    The counter until now was not really accurate because Jira does
    not provide a way to search for comments by date.
    
    That was leading to the delayed counter, sometimes, showing some
    issues as currently delayed when the messages were old.
    
    With this change, we fetch all the comments from candidate issues
    and verify their date corresponds to the last integration cycle.
    
    Only if the delayed messages are current, they are considered.
    
    Also, the final report is improved, showing who, when and how
    many times an issue has been delayed:

    Provide a dummy moodle_exception to fulfill needed stuff
    
    With MDL-66110 we are loading all the ddl/xmldb machinery
    to calculate quoted table names. That causes xmlize loading
    to fail because moodle_exception is not available.
    
    So this fix just provides a dummy moodle_exception in the
    job mini-bootloader avoiding to load the whole moodle boot code.

    MDLSITE-5313 make jenkins-cli stop consuming stdin
    
    In the context of a "while read..." loop, it was consuming
    all the lines silently, causing the loop to aparent that
    only the fist line was processed.
    
    Note that, for regular ssh, there is a (-n) switch that produces
    exactly the same effect. But here, it's used internally by jenkins-cli
    and there isn't any way to passthrough those switches. Or tomorrow we
    could be changing to any other connection protocol offered by Jenkins.
    
    So < /dev/null seems safe (there isn't anything more to read from stdin)
    and will continue working for any underlying stuff used within
    jenkins-cli.

    MDLSITE-5716 Fix parsing component names in the commit AMOScript
    
    Components with a digit in the name (such as auth_oauth2) were not

    the same fix is being copied over here.
    
    Extending the tests to cover both newly covered cases - valid component
    names with a digit, and invalid component name with double underscore.

    MDL-63346 npm: Moving away from git pathspecs to simpler grep excludes
    
    For some reason the git pathspec excludes aren't working as expected
    when run in subshell (maybe it's some weird escaping, expansion...) and
    haven't been able to keep it working for multiple.
    
    So, switching to old known filter out of results using grep -v
    and done. It supports multiples without problm and just works.

    NOBUG: Grunt to ignore changes caused by 3rd part libs

    NOBUG: Grunt to ignore changes caused by 3rd part libs
    
    Some plugins can come with their own 3rd part libs (thirdpartylibs.xml).
    That leads to grunt feeding .eslintignore and .stylelintignore to
    make js & css linters to ignore those 3rd part libe.
    
    But those changes, make the grunt check to fail as far as they lead
    to change in core detected when the check is being performed for a
    non-core plugin. So we just proceed to ignore changes in those files
    when it's the case.

    NOBUG: Parametrise jenkins cli connectiviy string vs prev. harcoded one.
    
    New versions of Jenkins CLI ask you to disable old, insecure CLI
    protocols in the Jenkins server. Because of that some "magic"
    authentication that was happening (jenkins user) does not work
    anymore. So we need to be able to pass the required connectivity
    setting to newer jennkins cli, more exactly:
    
    -s http://jenkis_public_url:8080 -ssh -user clibot
    
    to specify that we want to use localhost, via jenkins-own-ssh
    and with the keys of the jenkins user "clibot" that are the keys of
    os user "jenkins" running the jira client in shell. So they work.
    
    Note that the Jenkins own ssh port must be accessible by the caller
    so using -Dorg.jenkinsci.main.modules.sshd.SSHD.hostName can be handy
    if the public Jenkins URL is behind proxy or whatever. In general all
    the local_ci uses are local, so it's ok to have:
    
    -Dorg.jenkinsci.main.modules.sshd.SSHD.hostName=localhost
    
    and ignore any other complication or need to make jenkis_public_url
    available for ssh purposes.

    MDLSITE-5184 mustache_lint: Ensure eslint uses correct .eslintrc
    
    I was getting a consistent (testing) failure with error:
    
    Failed to load plugin promise: Cannot find module 'eslint-plugin-promise'
    
    And it was incredible because the test is using MOODLE_31_STABLE branch
    and the promise plugin was not used by that branch. At the end, it seems
    that eslint somehow merges the configs passed in the call and the
    configs present in the path (down-top). As far as I was running local_ci
    within a master moodle site, the eslint "promise" plugin was added to
    the execution and failed because the 31_STABLE node_modules does not
    have it.
    
    By adding --no-eslintrc we prevent eslint to search in own path, so only
    the --config alternative is considered. That's what we want. Exactly.

    MDLSITE-5134 ci: moving to nvm nodejs manager
    
    This does:
    - make both npmcmd and nodecmd globals optional,
      defaulting to "npm" and "node" respectively.
      (note there is MDLSITE-4728 about the final
      removal but surely we'll need to branch before
      that happens and delete other old bits like
      shifter/recess)
    - better printing the currently used npm/node versions.
    - in case grunt-cli needs to be installed explicitly (I've
      tried here with node 4, 6, 7 - npm 2, 3, 5 - and it was
      installed always), it's done with --no-save, so package
      and shrinkwrap files are not modified.
    - in prechecker, just moved the mandatory checks before
      applying defaults, to be the same than all other scripts.

    We do a few things here:
    
    1) Add a global npm depdency for the validator. This is actually a java
    bundle, but seems like a sensible way of managing the installation..
    
    2) In mustache_lint.sh, try and use the npm-installed validator if found
    
    3) Verify we are using the local installed versions in the tests.
    
    This *should* break the travis build now, because i've not got travis to
    npm install or use java.

commit d2c148cc28a5dfcf7d289e0338ac60a7a4760e90

    MDLSITE-4892 deal with spaces in passed varibles
    
    Because this comes from tracker fields, we can trim the spaces. Probably
    would be more appropiate in the remote branch checker, but its better
    covered with tests here and doesn't do any harm.
    
    I decided not to add a testcase for the 'ok with space' case to avoid
    wasting the time of a full precheck run.

    NOBUG: Ensure the local branch exists ad points to origin remote
    
    That way we can always checkout it in order to delete the
    _precheck one.

    NOBUG: Always delete any _precheck branch from previous executions

commit 05df6cbede8bd58456749b46352dfe4c36482c10

    NOBUG: Always delete any _precheck branch from previous executions
    
    We cannot delete the _precheck branches while they run because that
    will cause all the /work to be lost before being saved as artifacts.
    
    So, on every run, before performing any other git operation, we check
    if we are in a _precheck branch and, if so, proceed to checkout its
    base counterpart, checkout it and delete the _precheck branch and
    any old stuff it may have.
    
    Note this was introduced because we found some plugins having own
    .gitattributes files, playing with auto-crlf settings and causing
    next executions of the checker to fail forever. Now, we ensure
    nothing is left in the prechecker repo from previous executions.

    Now it's easier to handle the fixtures as far as,
    instead of comparing the whole fixture, each line is
    checked to exist in results independently.
    
    I've left the default format (format-excluded-expected.txt)
    unmodified so, at least, that one contains all current results
    but checked line by line. Other formats now just have a smaller
    set being checked.

    NOBUG: remove the SMURFRESULT assertion from prechecker tests
    
    The problem is that when we assert the smurf result in the console
    output we are just duplicating the assertion which is already happening
    by comparing the .xml file. But because we fail before looking at the xml
    file we don't get to see how the output differs.. which means in the
    case of random travis errors it makes it hard for us to diagnose what
    the problem is.
    
    Probably best just to remove that duplciated assertion and hopefully
    we'll be able to more easily work out whats going on in case of
    failures.

    MDLSITE-4806 remove the "ci" label when issues arrive to integration
    
    When an issue, having the ci label arrives to "waiting for integration"
    it's interesting to get the label cleaned, so the prechecker can verify
    that everything is correct against current upstream.
    
    This is specially noticeable in continuous-integration periods where
    the issues are never moved to "current integration" (monday automated
    job) so last prechecker results are really old (happened normally before
    peer-review).
    
    This job picks those issues and cleans the label, forcing an extra
    prechecker to happen. Has built in machinery to prevent the same issue
    to be cleaned too many times (in 1 hour) and other details. Should be
    safe to be executed at any time interval.

    MDLSITE-4790 mustache_lint: make eslint less noisy
    
    Based on some internal discussions I convinced myself:
    
    1) Not to output parse errors when there is missing example context,
    because this is often caused by the missing example context, its just
    adding noise which is covered by the previous warning.
    
    2) We should make all problems warnings because again they might be
    caused by missing example context. This is the same way we treat html
    validation
    
    If we had a codebase without these missing example context problems this
    wouldn't be an issue.

    NOBUG: Avoid the job to modify/fetch new stuff
    
    Basically current git status roots the execution.
    
    Looking to those fetches added (recently!) to the database compare
    job... i think maybe I added them because of ci tests not ensuring
    everything is available in the moodle.git clone (LOCAL_CI_TESTS_GITDIR).
    I think I needed it because I was pointing to ongoing integration.git
    clone (some tests were dependent of stuff being integrated that week).
    
    I thinkI'm going to, simply, kill the fetches because it's not the job
    responsibility to ensure that. travis already does full clone and the
    git jobs in jenkins do fetch everything (or can be configured for that f
    missing).

    MDLSITE-4767 regression: avoid prechecker deleting node_modules
    
    Prechecker, once has finished the tests requiring complete
    codebase, proceeds to delete all the non-patch files. That
    includes deleting ignored/excluded files.
    
    Since some hours ago we added node_modules to the list of excluded
    and that's leading to its deletion, so obviously nothing from
    node_modules is available anymore.
    
    So I just have added an exception to guarantee node_modules persists.

    MDLSITE-4767: Fix regexp variant of excluded to use proper regexp
    
    Apparently it was using some sort of * shell expansion, hence not
    working always. Now * is translated to proper .* regexp.
    
    As far as now *.csv are being excluded, we don't need individual
    lib/tests/fixtures/tabfile.csv anymore.
    
    Also get rid of mega-old "search" exclude that was causing lots of
    new search stuff not to be checked.
    
    And, finally, also "node_modules" that normally CIs don't face, but
    can be a source of problems/confusion when working locally.

    we may be missing some objects locally.

    MDLSITE-4722 Prevent site caches to fake columns specs
    
    This is a really "race/coincidence" situation I faced while
    perfoming all the changes. For some reason the Moodle site cache
    had cached the database metadata exactly on ccee2dc (a commit that
    did introduce differences between install and commit).
    
    Later the php script, that runs using the Moodle site,  was using
    that cached information irrespectively of the real schema in the
    database.
    
    It drove me really mad till I realized the cause. Now all
    metadata operations are performed with $usecache = false
    so this won't happen again. Grrr.

    MDLSITE-4722 ci: compare_databases php improvements
    
    The PHP job was really outdated and it was not following the
    database_column_info specs properly, leading to both PHP Notices
    and innacurate differences output.
    
    This PR just introspects database_column_info via reflection to
    get the correct list of properties to compare, moving from old
    array/stdclass approach.

    Replace unreliable fixture
    
    The fixture introduced in #126 seems to have unreliable results.. which
    caused variable phpcs failures in #125 - the failures seemed unrelated
    and not part of what was being tested, so simplify that fixture to stop
    me going crazy..

    Properly handle stylelint exit codes
    
    This prepares us for set -e everywhere, but also means we detect when
    stylelint complains about the glob pattern not matching (when there are
    not css files to lint).
    
    We use that exit code to make an empty stylelint.xml checkstyle file - to
    be consistent with other checks.

    Some tests for versions_check_set.sh
    
    Not exhasitive! There are a lot of things done by this script, more
    tests can be added.

    Verify more GNU coreutils depenencies and reverse course with wc
    
    This reverses course (and mostly reverses) changes in
    89a64f3d214511 and b76bc6f07 to make the scripts more tolerance to
    mac/bsd wc.
    
    After I started looking at versions_check_set I found another gnu
    depdency and I think its best to make the scripts simpler and less
    portable. If there is one or two gnu dependencies, its not worth having
    tolerances for other things like wc).
    
    Also make verify_commit_messages/verify_commit_messages.sh have +x
    permission.

      make it a bit more portable

    MDLSITE-4702: Add local helpers for doing running of scripts
    
    These helpers change the run behaviour so we no longer run the

    behaviour doesn't match the way which scripts are run with in the jenkins
    environement and can lead to errors with paths not included safely.

    MDLSITE-4702: Without moodle default chdir() we need to use absolute paths
    
    With PR #109 we deleted the job dependencies on Moodle. But it seems
    we forgot to notice (in fact tests were passing) the automatic chdir()
    call present in setup.php. Without it, no xlst sheets were found and
    the job ultimatelly was failing. Simple fix does switch to full paths
    so xslt sheets will be found without problem.

    Also paths/files containing whitespaces were completely broken,
    now are handled and supported properly.

    MDLSITE-4644 prechecker: make eslint to run out from exit-on-error
    
    It seems that in the last move we did put eslint under an
    exit-on-error section within the codechecker. That was leading
    to executions exiting with error when eslint detected some
    coding-style  problem.
    
    Note the fix is not the perfect fix, just a quick attempt to keep
    the things working. There are some linked issues where real
    improvements should happen:
    
    - MDLSITE-4625, about to properly inspect exit codes an output
        for every check and be able to discern correct executions
        from incorrect ones.
    - MDLSITE-4211, about to have the codechecker, and other local_ci
        stuff covered by own unit tests.

    MDL-52127 eslint: don't run grunt ignorefiles
    
    1) Because the final solution which landed to moodle.git put the
    ignorefile in git, so its not necessary
    
    2) Because this job was broken - the grunt task runs after we've deleted
    all the non-patch files. So a) the gruntfile wasn't there and b) if it
    was there it would be running with an incomplete thirdpartylibs.xml and
    generate the wrong ignorefile results
    
    closes #91

    Frequency can be adjusted using gcinterval (defaults to 25) and

    - if npmbase is not passed, then it will assume somebody else
      (caller) has prepared the npm stuff already and won't
      operate anything.

    NOBUG: Centralize all the npm install stuff
    
    Right now there are a bunch of jobs requiring the
    installation of different nodejs stuff with npm.
    
    A) Chain of jobs by branch.
    
    - For branches < 29 (without package.json file):
      - The job 'shifter_walk' uses 'shifterbase' to maintain different
        shifter versions per branch. (current value ~/shifter_base)
      - The job 'less_checker' uses 'recessbase' to maintain different
        recess versions per branch. (current value ~/recess_base)
    - For branches >= 29 (with package.json file):
      - The job 'grunt_process' uses 'npmbase' to maintain different stuff
        (grunt, shifter, less, jshint...) per branch. (current value
        ~npm_base).
    
    B) Prechecker.
    
      - The job 'remote_branch_checker'' uses 'npmbase' to maintain different
        stuff (grunt, shifter, less, jshint...) per branch. (current value
        ~npm_base_prechecker). Run by 'grunt_process' above.
    
    C) New uses could also require the installation of npm stuff. For sure
       in a different base from the already used above.
    
    So, this new job is a "universal" nodejs stuff installer, behaving as
    follows:
    
    1) npm will be in charge of installing any package.
    2) every use above (A, B, C) will use a different 'npmbase'.
    3) within every 'npmbase' stuff will be installed per branch, aka:
      - A's own npmbase/branchname/node_modules
      - B's own npmbase/branchname/node_modules
      - ....
    4) If package.json is available, both grunt-cli and package.json stuff
       will be installed. This is the way in 29 and up.
    5) If package.json is not available, but shifterversion has been
       specified, shifter@version will be installed. This is for < 29.
    5) If package.json is not available, but recessversion has been
       specified, recess@version will be installed. This is for < 29.
    6) At the end of the process all the installed binaries @
       node_modules/bin will be listed.
    7) Link the correct node_modules directory in the gitdir being used. The
       job using the installer will be in charge, if needed, of deleting the
       link once the job is done.
    
    Important note: This job does not perform any git operation (fetch,
    checkout...). Just requires the gitdir and gitbranch params in order to
    decide where packages will be installed and linked to.
    
    Once this job is available, the idea is to use it for new uses (C above)
    and also, progresively, replace all the current A & B uses above.
    
    That's it. Next step, replace, in the A, B jobs above, current partial
    installers of nodejs stuff by this universal alternative.

    NOBUG: Change the php code sniffer abbreviation
    
    When I see the output of a smurf report with php coding style
    problems, I frequently mistake it for the phplint check - which is
    much more serious problem.
    
    To avoid this confusion I propose to change the shortname to phpcs to
    make it clearer.

    MDLSITE-4366 savepoints: discard unsafe strings to avoid problems
    
    Now we pre-process the upgrade code, looking for all strings
    within it. If the string is considered dangerous (contains
    parenthesis and other chars, then it's replaced by safe placeholder
    so next regexp operations won't fail).
    
    Safe strings are kept in place in order to keep code transformations
    being as small as possible, in case we want to add more checks in
    the future (savepoint params checks...).

    MDLSITE-3818 cleanup: kill BUILD_ID and delete issues details
    
    This commit cleans all remaining jobs using BUILD_ID and, instead
    do use a calculated (now), BUILD_TIMESTAMP, that is what BUILD_ID
    used to contain. Note this is basically a cosmetic change to make
    scripts to show information as it was some time ago.
    
    Also, in various tracker jobs where a number of issues (with full
    details) are returned, to avoid any disclosure of (security...)
    information, the file where details are stored is explicitly
    deleted at the end of the process.

    MDLSITE-4334 counters: Define the expected date format
    
    With the upgrade to JIRA CLI, date formats are not returned
    in d/MMM/yy format anymore, but d/M/yy h:m instead. That causes
    matching problems and end of cycles are not detected anymore.
    
    So we are ensuring that the expected d/MMM/yy is always used.

    MDLSITE-4200 ci: raise integration priority when needed
    
    There are some well known situations:
      - issue has "mdlqa" label.
      - issue has certain "Must fix for X.Y" version.
    
    Where we must give those issues higher prioring under
    continuous integration periods. Till now we do that using
    separate filters or custom searches.
    
    Instead, with this job, those issues will be searched periodically
    and their "integration priority" will be raised to 1, so they will
    appear the first under unmodified pickers.

    MDLSITE-4198 ci: split maxcommits into warning(10) and error(100)

    MDLSITE-4198 ci: split maxcommits into warning(10) and error(100)
    
    To better support branches with a number of commits, the old, unique,
    maxcommits setting is changed plugin-wide to use a couple of settings
    instead.
    
    Also, we are moving from an eroor&stop behavior (where the rest of the
    checks were not applied) to a error/warn and continue behavior, by
    showing the maxcommits warnings and errors within the commits checker.
    
    This may lead to problems is somebody does submit a huge/wrong branch,
    but that also was happening right now irrespectively of the # of
    commits. If we need countermeasures for that situation, time will tell.

    NOBUG: Allow the maxcommits to be configurable

    NOBUG: Allow the maxcommits to be configurable
    
    While we recently raised maxcommits to 100 (harcoded in the script),
    there are situations where we want to raise the limits more,
    specially when we are importing a branch containing years-of-dev
    about a new plugin.
    
    In those situations it's interesting to launch the bulk-checker manually
    by incrementing the number of allowed commits.
    
    A real example: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-47494
    (there you can see all the "failed" CiBoT attempts and the interest
    into being able to, exceptionally, run the checker with more commits
    allowed).

    NOBUG: Avoid weird dereferenced links std behavior.
    
    By default, ln itself follows links so, at the end
    it's highly possible to get them recursively created
    no matter they already exists. To solve this the -n
    flag can be used, causing ln not to follow links.
    
    Or, something like that, really I've not thought too
    much about it. I just tried the flag and verified it
    solved the problem, so applying it everywhere.

    MDLSITE-3874 ci: make source per branch to use node_modules subdir
    
    For some reason, soft linked installation of node stuff does not
    work well unless the source directory is called node_modules. Sure
    there are some realpath bit somewhere (grunt?) depending of that.
    
    Ultimately it was causing grunt to fail, not being able to execute
    the uglify-js task. With this trick, everything seems to work ok.

    This job does:
    
    - maintains 1 directory with all the nodejs stuff installed.
    - every 25 jobs performs a npm update
    - runs grunt that executes shifter (for yui modules), uglifyjs (for
      amd modules) and jshint.
    - reports any problem or difference between the repository status
      and the calculated stuff.

    The problem was the existing rule relied on having subdirectories (i.e.
    lib/yui/build/some-random-module/built.js for yui). Where as amd doesn't
    have this strcuture so its just lib/amd/build/some-module-min.js). Doing
    it this way means a more blanket ignore for yui, but think thats
    desierable anyway.

    MDLSITE-4023 bulk prechecker: Look for controlled errors.
    
    We output to the errors.txt file information with different
    levels (Info, Warn, Error). Before this patch, any level was
    causing the errors.txt to be printed, leading to confusion.
    
    Now we check if there is any Error level message to print that
    file. If there isn't any error, then an uncontrolled error has
    happened and we should be warned in order to fix it.

      (previously they were ignored because of their existence
      in the excluded files).

    CONTRIB-4696 Apply distributed thirdpartylibs.xml to CI jobs
    
    Originally we introduced the ability to automatically exclude
    all the thirdpartylibs.xml locations to the local_codechecker
    plugin (phpcs invoked from within Moodle).
    
    CI jobs do not use that phpcs but the stock one that is not
    aware of our thirdpartylibs.xml at all. Instead, it relies in
    a fixed list of exclusions, that has worked nicely till now
    for core.
    
    Recently we have started to use the CI jobs to test plugins
    that can come with their own thirdpartylibs.xml, and those
    exclusions are not being applied.
    
    This patch just looks for all the available thirdpartylibs.xml
    files and add as many <location> exclusions are defined there.

    Agreed with David, all his builds from the Plugins database will
    be passing PLUGIN-xxxxx (xxxx being the plugin version id) to the
    prechecker.
    
    That way the prechecker will know the execution is against a plugin
    and will skip the commits checker (for now) and will be able to
    introduce other customizations along the time (keeping the prechecker
    working for everybody).

    MDLSITE-3680 improve error handling
    
    When I was testing MDLSITE-3680 I drove myself crazy trying to work out
    where a problem was occuring - it turned out that the
    
    git checkout MOODLE_27_STABLE && git reset (etc etc) was failing, then
    it was continuing to process based on the existing merge branch, from
    the previous run. This makes the script die when one of these operations
    fail.

    MDLSITE-3680 fix integration.git detection
    
    Previously our detection of the ancestor was not always finding the
    correct ancestor. By using git merge-base be find the point which git
    will use for a 3 way merge i.e. the point it forked.

    MDLSITE-2712 fix problem calculating branch ages against integration
    
    - --boundary was returning non-target commits.
    - small cleanup of current directory.
    - simplified to always look for ancestor from HEAD (already checked-out)
    - for integration.git checks, perform them since ancestor, not tip.
    - for moodle.git checks, perform them since tip (as was previously).

    MDLSITE-2712 tidying, commenting and reorganizing a bit
    
    This change contains basically cosmetic changes only to
    comments, initial creation of integration.git remote and
    tidying exit-on-error.
    
    The only remarkable change is that, now, the ancestor to be
    used is calculated (using the same way it was previously) and
    only then all the checks begin (including the branch aging ones
    that previously were executed always for the moodle.git ancestor).

    - calculation of the summary section.
    - applied to both xml and html formats.
    - enforce the generation of xml format unconditionally.
    - get rid of the "details" collapsable section.
    - minor anchor-navigation improvements.

    MDLSITE-2003 - php syntax checker
    
    To avoid syntax erors in the codebase. Note that this just runs lint
    against the current state of the files in the codebase. We could do
    something cleverer with git to checkout the contents of the file from
    each commit, but in the end this way is simpler and doing less work and
    checks the current state of the repo - so its probably no bad thing.
    
    Also detect BOM characters (thanks to Matteo for the suggestion)

    So putting that under the control of a new, disabled by default,

    MDLSITE-3422 ci: Various improvement to smurf files
    
    This commit solves/improves these:
    
    XML:
    - Added "numerrors" and "numwarnings" attributes to every check.
    - Added grand totals for the above to the <smurf> element.
    
    HTML:
    - Show the new totals from the XML.
    - Group problems by file, clearly separanting them.
    - Difference errors (red) and warnings (orange).
    - Cleverer handling of line numbers.
    - Dim the "details" section to make it less prominent.
    
    And, of course, update the hash-hack to detect 100% correct results
    (note this will be replaced by a better solution in MDLSITE-3423)

    MDLSITE-3413 ci: get rid of last comment date
    
    Temporarily this field has been disabled in the Tracker
    (because of some incompatibility). That has caused the
    bulk checker to stop working completely.
    
    Getting rid of the field seems to be the only solution
    to keep them working. Ideally we'll revert this commit
    once the field is available again.

    MDLSITE-1990 fix plural issue

    MDLSITE-1990 ci: enforce checkstyle generation.
    
    Before this, both the savepoints and the commit checkers were
    generating and empty .xml checkstyle file. In the other side,
    both the code checker and the phpdocs checker were always
    generating their .xml files.
    
    That caused the former ones to not be present in the final smurf
    files always, making it hard to use a constant checksum to look
    for perfect issues (no warnings and no errors).
    
    So, now... those .xml files will be always created, no matter they
    don't contain any problem.

    MDLSITE-1990 ci: Integrate into results file
    
    - Moved the already existing savepoints checker to the end of the report.
    - Added the commit checker to the report.
    - Minor tweaks to allow 0-lines to pass the filtering always.
    - Added new atteribute "type=error|warning" to the smurf xml (will need it later).
    - Updated the checksum to detect problem-free reports.

    NOBUG: Simple cleanup
    
    This commit just moves the calculation of the components some lines
    above, so we keep the 2 real check areas:
    
    - checks requiring the whole code base.
    - checks working against the changed files.
    
    properly isolated. 1st step towards introducing the new "framework"
    to specify, run and report new "pluggable" checks. Coming soon.

    MDL-45486 Handle different versions separately
    
    Now the setter accepts 2 different versions to be
    used, one for versions (setversion) and another for
    dependencies/requires (setrequires). The later defaults
    to the former.
    
    That way we can bump all versions to major release date
    while keeping all dependencies pointing to a recent, already
    released version (usually some RC).
    
    At the same time, some other improvements are landing with
    this change like:
    
    - Better handling of comments in dependencies.
    - Better handling of git repos ignored/excluded.

    NOBUG: Handle moodle.git clones internally.
    
    With this change the job does not need the
    presence of the git plugin defined anymore.
    
    Right now it was more an obstacle than a help
    because it had to be configured strangely (pointing
    to a old branch/commit), to avoid it leading to
    the job own operations in the git repo.
    
    So, with this change the job itself manages both the
    initial clone and the cleaning before proceeding with the checks.

    into another alternative path, to avoid it being cleaned

    Any other script requiring composer stuff (phpunit, behat for now)
    will have to execute this script and, magically, the executables
    will be available for them.

    along the execution of the script, we are also looking for
    any information in output not being part of the standard
    progress report (lines of dots with some numbers and % at the end).
    
    This should allow us to detect anything incorrect, sent
    with error_log() and friends (both to standard and error output).

    Before this change, the script was returning paths

    plugin, instead of paths of the git repo being checked.
    
    This only was affecting 2.5 and previous, because for those
    versions is when we need the real site. For 2.6 and upwards
    getting components can happen without any site installed.

    - Sets the Currently in integration field.
    - Removes the "ci" label (so bulk "awaiting-integration" will catch them).

    MDLSITE-2690 Get rid of token logins everywhere
    
    Once checked that the bulk-checker is working ok without
    token logins, this commit applies the same change to
    all the other tracker jobs.

    MDLSITE-2690 Get rid of token logins in the bulk-checker
    
    It's causing problems by locking the cibot account
    randomly and only works for SOAP apis, so any action
    using REST apis will fail (and REST is the future of Jira).

    Every time an issue is sent back to development (from

    the "ci" label to cause the issue to be pre-checked again
    next time it's sent to peer review or integration.

    MDLSITE-2664 Send feedback to the tracker on error
    
    There are some small checks built in the bulk checker
    detecting basic errors (missing repository, no branches...)
    and they, right now, are preventing the Tracker to get
    notified about them (information only remains @ jenkins).
    With this change, the tracker will be notified, so everybody
    knows about those basic mistakes.
    
    NOTE: This commit also includes some small changes to output.

    While we advance a bit on prechecker improvements, when
    non-quiet operations are selected for awaiting integration
    issues, we restrict comments to integrators. Results will help to:
    
    1) integrate the issue.
    2) discover things to be added to the prechecker.

    NOBUG: Split processing server url and publish one.
    
    It has been detected that pointing to the public URLs of the
    jenkins servers leads to stream problems when the jenkins-cli
    is controlling the execution of jobs. Instead it must use
    the "direct" url so communications aren't broken. In the other side,
    the publish URL is needed to spread results out there, allowing any
    developer to connect and watch results.
    
    Also integration_held issues have been excluded from both the
    peer-review and awaiting-integration lists.

    This script looks for the changes between 2 commits

    status = 0). If there isn't any match, then it's
    safe to skip the tests (exit status = 1).

    that will save some precious minutes on each iteration. Also will
    benefit the prechecker (previously always using the moodle-ci-site

    Since 2.6 version.php files are expected to be present

    Once the test ends, we need to delete local/ci or phpunit
    tests will detect it as a "wrong" (missing version.php) plugin.

    NOBUG: Run the script against installed site.
    
    Before this change, the script was being executed
    from the moodle_ci_site by hacking CFG->dirroot and
    reseting caches, so plugin information was gathered
    from an uninstalled site.
    
    After this change, the shell script creates a real
    site and the php script is executed from that just
    created site. So the list of plugins is 100% real.
    
    Is slower, but the only way to get it 100% accurate.

    Reset core_component caches before asking for components
    
    Now local_ci requires Moodle 2.6dev (201307104) so the new
    core_component stuff is available always.
    
    No matter of that we continue using the old (deprecated in 2.6
    and upwards) get_plugin_types|subsystems|...() calls. Some day we'll
    move to the new methods available within core_component.
    
    But the key change here is that, via inheritance, we add a reset() method
    able to clean the static caches built in the class, so the nasty hack of
    forcing dirroot will continue working and the components will be returned
    properly.
    
    Personally I'm not happy with this solution (double-hack), but it's the fastest
    one I've been able to achieve. In the future we should, somehow install
    the site properly, ask for the list of components and store it into some "work"
    directory so other jobs can reuse it. But not today. :-(

    This is not failing on my local jenkins, but on integration
    and stronk7 it is reporting the wrong directory as the prefix for the
    plugins (the local_ci dir - not the master branch dir).
    
    Testing to see if setting dirroot before clearing the cache fixes this.

    NOBUG: ignores now used both by checker and setter
    
    The list of version.php files to ignore was harcoded
    both in the checker and the setter and, when executing
    the setter @ MDL-39434 it was detected that the list
    had become out of sync.
    
    This change just unifies the list of ignores (regular
    expression under $gitdir) and applies it both to the
    checker and the setter.

    MDLSITE-2100 ci: never reset to origin, can contain newer commits
    
    All the jobs that are chained per branch cannot be reset to
    their origin/xxxx counterpart because it's possible that the
    git poll already had incorporated commits for the next run. So
    the reset is performed to local branch and done.
    
    Note that the git poll itself is configured to renew the local
    branches once the next run starts (not before, poll knows that
    it has to wait until the whole chain ends before renewing local
    branches).

    MDLSITE-2127 Do not use trailing slashes for $excluded_list
    
    Recently a bunch of utilities (phpcpd, phploc) changed to
    Symfony's Finder that does not allow trailing slashes at the
    end, so we are trimming all them for $excluded_list that is
    onlu used by those utilities.

    NOBUG: Set the correct transitions.
    
    With current workflow, only these transitions

    - Integration review in progress => Reopened.
    - Problem during testing => Reopened.
    
    So we are only going to look for them.

    MDLSITE-2005 Use FROM...TO for transitions search
    
    Before this we were looking for independent statuses

    Now we are looking for proper transitions using the CHANGED FROM TO
    constructor, that I'm not sure why was ignored by me previously, grrr.

    MDLSITE-2005 Waiting for Inte => Reopened ignored
    
    Take out the Waiting for Integration => Reopened transition
    because it was leading to a lot of false positives being
    counted. It's really a pitty not being able to specify, in
    historic searches, any custom field, like "Currently in integration".
    
    So, once applied, this job will look, exclusively for these
    "transitions" since last integration cycle was closed:
      - Integration in progress => Reopened
      - Waiting for testing => Reopened
      - Passed => Reopened
      - Failed => Reopened
      - Tested => Reopened

    This scripts perform all the actions needed to get one

    creating all the directories, databases, database users and
    the moodle ci site instance.
    
    It's safe to execute it multiple times as far as every action
    is verified before execution.
    
    Take a look to the comments in the script to know the requirements
    and the environmental variables needed.
    
    It can be executed manually or from within Jenkins. The later, the
    recommended. Take a look to the "Initial Jenkins Moodle Setup" job
    in Moodle integration ci servers.

    Skip using the cli generator under 20 and 21 stables. It's not working.
    
    It never has been, but recent changes to improved error handling have
    caused the problem to be better detected, leading to failure. So now
    we are explicity skipping the generator under 20 and 21 stables.

    Added the --no-edit option to avoid commit msg editor. New default behaviour since git 1.7.10
    
    Note this should not affect this utility when executed by the CI server, because git
    detects if it's being run in interactive mode or no. But we explicity set it to avoid
    problems if executed manually.
