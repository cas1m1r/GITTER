A free and open-source, modular Remote Administration Tool (RAT) / Payload Dropper written in Go(lang) with a flexible command and control (C2) system*.

<sub>\* The C2 system can consist of static files on a HTTP server, static DNS records on a DNS server, or can be automated with a control panel (though this is not part of this project and while I may make a panel eventually, you are encouraged to make your own by all means).</sub>

# WARNING!
This is the In-Development branch **which has become the default branch as of 21/06/2020**. Any code found here is most likely **not tested, unstable and subject to change** as the project develops. To use the stable version please see the *releases* tab or the [master](https://git.0x1a8510f2.space/0x1a8510f2/wraith/src/branch/master) branch.

## NOTE:
The master branch currently contains Wraith v3.0.0 which is permanently in BETA due to a complete Wraith re-write for version 4.0.0. While useable, v3.0.0 of Wraith is not recommended for use. Instead, waiting for the 4.0.0 release is preferable as massive changes will be introduced making Wraith faster, more secure, more useable and easier to manage. Wraith v4.0.0 has no estimated release date but any contributions will speed up development :)

    Tweak tests to work with garble
    Garble apparently is more strict than the go command when it comes to
    _test package names. This commit cleans up some of the test files to
    work around this (the workaround will stay though, because it's cleaner
    this way anyway).

    Switch to garble for CI build
    As the CI spec is the only current build documentation,
    it would be wise to include the intended build method
    in the CI spec. Garble obfuscates Go binaries such that
    reverse engineering becomes very difficult. The "tiny",
    "seed=random" and "literals" flags also increase
    the difficulty. This should also make things more
    difficult for antimalware software.

    Rename system exec module to match new convention

commit d8f3c866301861141177fccb0440bab68c753522
Author: 0x1a8510f2 <admin@0x1a8510f2.space>
Date:   Sun Apr 3 20:56:39 2022 +0100

    Various deps changes
    - Temporarily comment errors in comms module to allow build
    - Add pinecone deps for comms manager
    - Remove vendoring - this is unfortunate as I prefer to have everything
    in one place and would much rather builds not require an internet
    connection once the code is cloned. However, given the pinecone deps,
    the repo would have gotten much too big.

commit 38f235a79ee6c06ea13985ed48cc8a4126b3078a

    Unify commsmgr and protocol module
    Coordinating communication between the comms manager and individual
    protocol modules would have been a nightmare. Instead, the comms manager
    will do all the communicating. This should make stuff a lot cleaner.
    Included in this commit is my initial attempt at making a Matrix
    Pinecone + JWT-based comms manager module. It only contains some initial
    code and is currently non-functional. This also means that the pinecone
    module is gone.

commit 585b482bc0abdd4a4a7ecf2169920c48f85cc816

Date:   Sun Apr 3 19:44:05 2022 +0100

    Module tweaks (see below)
    - Module mainloops no longer return errors. This means that the only
    way to send errors up the stack now is panicking. This emphasizes that
    modules should *never* error unless they cannot proceed.
    - Tx and Rx queues have been removed. Instead of having the Wraith or
    modules decide what gets sent to C2, I've decided to give C2 access to
    the shm over the comms protocol. This increases versatility.

    Change all `interface{}` to `any`
    Backwards compatibility? What's that?
    Anyway, this is more concise, looks better and makes it more difficult
    to use EOL Go versions with this codebase. I see no downsides. Rolling
    release distros rule!

    Move libwraith/Premade.go to stdmod/misc.go
    The reasoning behind this is that stdmod serves this exact purpose - to
    provide pre-made parts to allow one to get up and running quickly.
    Hence, the pre-made fingerprint generators and any future additions
    likely fit best here. Also, while at it, I shortened the names of the
    generators. Glad we don't have a compatibility promise yet :P

    Verious tweaks (see below)
    - Minor optimisation if exit signals are to be ignored
    - New SHM cell, SHM_WRAITH_STATUS, used to keep track of Wraith's
    current state. This is also used by Wraith.Kill() now to request exit.
    This cell is the first to be "protected" meaning that it can only be
    written to by Wraith itself.
    - New constants used to represent Wraith's status, prefixed with WSTATUS
    - To facilitate the protection of SHM cells, beginning with
    SHM_WRAITH_STATUS, proxy methods of the Wraith object must now be used
    to access the SHM and other properties of Wraith. This also means that
    all properties have now been made private.
    - More comments
    - New FamilyId Wraith config option, used to identify strains/builds of
    Wraith if needs be.
    - Fingerprint string has been replaced with a fingerprint generator
    function which can be custom. This is meant to make fingerprint
    generation more flexible.
    - Comment out w_feature_execgo tmp code - the errors/warnings were
    bothering me and it's not in use yet anyway.

    More SHM tweaks
    - Locking moved from cells to the actual SHM; this saves a little
    memory because only one lock exists as opposed to one per cell, but
    also slows some calls a little because all calls block, not just those
    on the same cell. This is necessary however as there were still some
    possible races with cell-level locking, such as when two calls are made
    accessing a non-existent cell - one cell would be overwritten by the
    other.
    - The SHM now automatically initalises because this is easier to manage
    and keep track of. It does have some minor performance overhead
    but... oh well.

    SharedMemory tweaks
    - Move timeout and channel size config to Constants.go
    - Make notify() wait for all goroutines to exit before returning
    - Give notification channels a buffer of 255 to increase chances of
    in-order delivery significantly (in fact, as long as no write times out,
    the new "wait for goroutines" mechanism guarantees in-order delivery for
    notifs)
    - Reduce timeout to 1 second (with the new 255 buffer size, there should
    never really be a timeout unless something goes very wrong. On the other
    hand, if something does go wrong, a 15 second timeout would make every
    write to that memory cell take 15 seconds).

    Increase the SharedMemory notify timeout to 15s
    Goroutines are quite light so this shouldn't matter too much, and it
    seems like I've gotten pretty dependent on the notify updates being
    reliable, so might as well make them a bit more so. The only issue I
    can still see is that, if the notify channel is blocked for a while,
    another update might come through and they could arrive out of order. I
    suppose I can incease the channel buffer to solve that maybe :thonk:.

    Various tweaks (see below)
    - Finally should build!
    - HUGE simplification of libwraith. The lib is now as barebones as it
    can possibly get. This has the negative impact that modules will need to
    be more complex, but the positive part is that I will make those modules
    anyway so complexity is simply moved from the core to modules which is
    good because, should I overcomplicate stuff as I tend to do, anyone can
    easily replace my overcomplicated stuff with their own, while keeping
    the good bits of Wraith.
    - Various small bug fixes which should prevent some panics.
    - General cleanup.

    A MASSIVE restructure
    I know I know - I've done nothing but re-structure the code recently.
    However, the code is now up to a standard which I am completely happy
    with: it is extremely modular with standard and non-standard modules
    being included in the exact same way; it splits the core parts into
    libwraith allowing for it to be included effortlessly in other Go
    programs as a backdoor; the layout is very clean and should be easy
    enough to contribute to; and there is a central Wraith structure which
    means that all config and other shared data can easily be managed
    centrally. This should be the final significant re-structure.
    
    Also, I've removed the hooks completely because they weren't really that
    useful and didn't play too well with the new architecture. I may

    Fix remaining errors so Wraith builds
    These are purely compilation errors and some logic errors could still
    exist. However, the new module system should be more or less functional,
    which is a big step forward! :D

    - Complete home repo move
    - Further ModMgr tweaks to hopefully improve and make more generic the
    module system
    
    Note: this commit still doesn't build, more work is needed to switch all
    code to the new module manager system.

    Simplify comms stuff
    Previously, each tx or rx had to import comms, so to avoid dependency
    cycles, the main file in turn imported those. This felt quite ugly.
    Now, txs and rxs no longer depend on comms, so everything should be a
    little cleaner overall as comms can now import those.

    Add comms translator component
    This should allow for encoding payloads in various ways to make them
    much less detectable.

    Various work on the radio module

commit 6a89d091c07c581b437c3714020daa1a417b9883

    Further config tweaks
    I've decided that instead of directly impacting how Wraith runs, the c2
    will simply edit Wraith's config which will also eventually contain a
    payload. This means that it is less likely that anything breaks, and
    in general the codebase can be much simpler because I can just reference
    the config everywhere. Though, this does mean the options should
    probably not be called "default"

    Added option to configure the interval at which...
    the comms trigger function executes

commit aa235f7768b00c19e9d24f2d18520462588d23d8
Author: TR-SLimey <37966924+TR-SLimey@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 24 13:02:42 2020 +0000

    Switched from an interval to a trigger function...
    for transmit and receive. This is superior as it allows more flexibility
    as the trigger function can trigger at specified times, or in certain
    conditions which makes for a much less detectable and predictable
    program.

    Removed entire SERVER code
    The reason why the server side was implemented in web technologies was
    to make communications stealthier and the C2 server easier to host.
    However, while this sufficed for this purpose, a further improvement
    would be to not have any server-side code at all. That way, there would
    be much less maintenance for me, while also less chances of
    vulnerabilities for the user, and more flexibility with hosting the C2,
    with an only slight increase in difficulty of control. For this reason,
    I have decided that this is a good decision to make, and Wraith will
    therefore now consist only of one binary, the client, which will fetch
    its commands from static files and DNS requests

    I have been able to find a project which allows compiling Go in the
    browser. With some luck, I will embed this functionality into the panel

    are relatively unmodified from the original and so, are not yet
    functional for our purpose.

    API now reports the assigned ID and base heartbeat delay on handshake
    This commit allows the API to report the assigned ID of the Wraith and
    the base delay between heartbeats when a handshake is completed. The
    baseHeartbeatDelay is dynamic and adjusted to the mark dead setting for
    Wraiths.

    Added fingerprint generator for connecting Wraiths
    Connecting Wraiths will now be assigned a fingerprint based on the
    architecture they are running on, the hostname of the computer they are
    running on, the OS type they are running on and the user they are
    running under. This data was chosen as it is unlikely to change and
    should collectively be unique between Wraiths.

    Removed non-working plugin implementation
    The compile-time plugin implementation is far from ready and is making
    Wraith unrunnable so it was commented out temporarily until development of
    the plugin system resumes.
    Also, the development-time address of the API was edited for easier
    development in the new environment.

    Comment clarity and small tweak
    
    Some comments were changed to include more useful details (and some
    useless comments were removed). The glob for protocol files was also
    changed from * to ? in order to better match the protocol which only
    allows one character to define the protocol version

    Made panel UI updating more flexible
    The old system forced all data to be interpreted as text, but the new
    system allows data to be interpreted in any way, and gives each piece of
    data its own function.

    Removed BUILDER directory and info.txt
    Wraith is made in Golang which compiles down to WebAssembly. This means
    that Go code can run in a browser. As the Go toolchain is made in Go, I
    am hoping to integrate the builder with the panel, to allow generating
    Wraith executables anywhere from the panel itself. This would make
    Wraith much more versatile and quicker to deploy as well as easier to
    build and use.

Author: TR-SLimey <tr_slimey@protonmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 3 17:59:04 2020 +0100

    Started work on re-designing the command management system
    Previously, the targets for a command were planned to be stored as JSON
    within the command entry. This was not good enough however since it
    would be near impossible to efficiently filter commands by the Wraith(s)
    it was aimed at. Instead, a switch to a one-entry-per-target system is
    planned, which will utilise an event as a reference to what the command
    is, and simply point Wraiths to it.

    key will be regenerated on every POST request to the API unlike the
    session first layer key which is re-generated on every PUT request
    (manager login attempt).

    Added fail counter to end session in case the server reply was invalid
    If 4 consecutive messages from the server contain no valid data, the
    panel will now end the session to indicate that something has gone
    wrong, and log this action to the console. The API will occassionally
    send data-less replies if something has gone wrong but the exact error
    will often be printed by api.js aleady so it's safe to assume that if an
    error happened 4 times in a row, the session should be reset.

    Moved IP locking code to be after $thisSession rearranging
    The previous code referenced creatorIP as an index of a list of
    sessions. Now however, it correctly references it as an index of the
    session.

    Sessions will now be IP-locked to prevent session hijacking though the
    system will allow non-IP-locked sessions when a wildcard is supplied in
    the creatorIP field.

    Removed stats management functions from DBManager completing work on it
    Due to the removal of the stats table and a switch to events instead,
    the stats management functions have been removed. They were the final
    unconverted functions (other than command management which is not
    implemented for now) in DBManager so work on DBManager is now finished
    temporarily. More work will likely be done as bugs are uncovered and
    tweaks need to be made but for now, DBManager should be functional.

    Also removed semicolons from the end of SQL queries as they are not
    required, and can cause problems when using filters hence removing them
    avoids confusion.
    Also fixed a bug in dbExpireWraiths where a SQL parameter was assigned
    to a variable within the params array instead of putting it in the
    params array due to cut+paste mistake.

    Moved user creation to a 0 user check instead of db init check
    Previously, the SuperAdmin account was created only if the database was
    uninitialised. This could cause situations where no account is left
    active which then makes the API inaccessible for management. Instead,
    the default account will now be created every time no other user account
    exists.

    Minor isDatabasePostInit tweaks
    Added `LIMIT 1` to the SQL query. I don't believe SQLite allows multiple
    tables of the same name but better safe than sorry. The `LIMIT 1` will
    make the query that little bit more predictable and efficient should
    something go wrong with the database. Also edited (shortened) comment.

    Removed DBManager::SETTINGS
    The DBManager should only provide a layer for the application to
    interact with the database. It already provides a function for fetching
    the settings so a hard-coded fetching of the settings whenever an
    instance is created seems pointless and makes DBManager less efficient
    in scenarios when settings do not need to be fetched.

    The filter system will need to be re-designed a little so it has been
    temporarily removed. For easier maintainability and better security
    (ensuring that prepared statements are used everywhere) SQLExec has been
    added and functions will start using it in later commits.

    dbAddWraith standardised parameters fix

commit e824e8e78877b0365ab89b5354d5ea37df3e5b96
Author: TR-SLimey <tr_slimey@protonmail.com>
Date:   Sun May 31 01:11:49 2020 +0100

    Standardised database mgmt function parameters Add - $data Remove - $filter Get - $filter Set - $name, $value The functions do not yet use their updated parameters so there will be many errors.
    
    Also, a function to update a Wraith's last heartbeat time was added as
    there is no reason for it to exist for sessions but not Wraiths.

    Moved location of API files
    The files will now be in a directory representing the major version of
    the API (v4 currently). This is to allow having multiple API versions on
    one server to support legacy Wraiths as well as newer Wraiths. Each
    major API version (directory) has its own database to APIs do not
    interfere with eachother.

    Renamed "panel" to "manager"
    Since the API should be usable from almost any interface, not just
    panels ( maybe eventually Wraiths will be able to be managed by sending
    messages to a bot :thinking: ), the naming convention was changed from
    "panel" to "manager" for more ambiguity.

    the page loaded. Wrapping in window.onload removed the race condition.

    Added JavaScript detection & requirement
    As the panel cannot really fetch or send data without JavaScript
    XMLHttpRequests, nor can in encrypt its messages to comply with the
    protocol, it is pointless to access it with JavaScript disabled. To
    prevent confusion, a warning will now be shown when a user with
    JavaScript disabled attempts to access the panel, and the panel will not
    be accessible.

    also be shipped as an Electron app though this is only an idea at the
    moment.

Author: TR-SLimey <tr_slimey@protonmail.com>
Date:   Wed May 6 16:35:06 2020 +0100

    Changes to work with the previous commit
    Made changes to the protocol and improved the use of interfaces
    to better work with the most recent API changes

commit 720922b663561ba9e3bcc5676dee8fb7ce929672
Author: TR-SLimey <tr_slimey@protonmail.com>
Date:   Wed May 6 16:32:12 2020 +0100

    Major database and protocol restructure
    Changed the way settings, stats and Wraith are stored and
    added working db_add_wraiths and db_expire_wraiths functions.
    The protocol has also been changed as information about Wraith
    and the Host has been placed in their own sub-dictionaries within
    a handshake request.

commit 9cab96bbbd31ee2a9e4430547c20d21085105a6e
Author: TR-SLimey <tr_slimey@protonmail.com>
Date:   Wed May 6 14:12:05 2020 +0100

    Improved data handling and API communication
    Switched to using go interfaces for storing some of the data
    sent between the API and Wraith for a more robust communication
    supporting more data types. The interface switch seems to work
    but will need to be thoroughly tested as the Wraith was not
    initially designed with interfaces in mind. A basic handshake
    system is also in progress.

    Added legacy versions of the wraith to the repository
    I have found some old versions of the wraith project. Each most significant
    digit increment means a complete re-write of the code, each least
    significant digit increment means a minor change in the code,
    and each middle digit increment means a major change in the code.
    WARNING: None of the legacy wraith files are or will be supported. Please
    see legacy/WARNING.txt

    Added `verify=False` when getting the address of the server
    There might be a decrypting proxy between the wraith and the server so
    SSL errors are ignored when getting the address. However, they are not
    ingored when making API calls as sensitive information could be sent.

    Added more libraries to the wraith so more commands can be ran.
    In environments such as a PyInstaller executable, wraith modules cannot
    import libraries that aren't imported by the main file. Hence, some
    additional libraries were added so that more flexibility is possible
    with commands even though the wraith itself does not use these
    libraries.

    The wraith can now send back results of the

    back the commands it got

    The database file was not locked correctly by the API script (typo in
    variable name) which could lead to errors.

    Added full support for refreshing panel info page
    Both the API and the panel now allow refreshing the panel in the
    background. However, only the info page refreshing in the API and panel
    is implemented as of right now. The API function was also once again
    moved to a separate file to allow using it from the panel refreshing
    worker.
    Minor bug fixes were also introduced and the wraith script was made
    executable.

    Renamed the client file to just wraith.py
    Previously the file was called wraith_3.0.1.py. This is because wraith
    versions 1 and 2 were prototypes and were never finalised. However, the
    file was renamed for simplicity.
