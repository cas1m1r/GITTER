Password Controls and Security Policies

~Overview:

As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. You often need to know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organization’s IT system, thus circumventing most of perimeter controls in place.

~Project Objective:

What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?

What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?

What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?

After the conducted analysis it was determined that organization uses an outdated password hashing algorithm (MD5) which offers very little protection in the event of a password database leaking. It was also determined that the current password policy is not aligned with industry best practices allowing users to have short passwords (6 characters) and reuse usernames as part of passwords.

As a result of the analysis the following uplifts are proposed to increase the overall level of password protection:

• Use a dedicated password hashing algorithm bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2 as this will greatly increase the time needed to crack individual passwords,

• Implement salting to prevent usage of rainbow tables to speed up cracking,

• Increase the minimum password length requirement to 10 characters – this will increase the computational effort required to crack password and will give additional time to change all passwords in the event of the password database being leaked,

• Prevent passwords to be the same as usernames or reused as part of the password – such password combination is easy to check without gaining access to the password database itself.

• It is advised to educate users on creating safe and easy to remember passwords. Having a password policy requiring long passwords with a number of special characters results in user writing passwords down or constantly resetting them. The best way to create a strong and user-friendly password is using passphrases (e.g. mygrannyschairhadstaples). The best way to create such passwords is to combine a couple of completely random word. It’s also advised to use some special characters and numbers as easy to remember substitutions to expand the key space (e.g. mYgranny$cha1rhadstaples)

• Educate users on the benefits of passwords managers. Having a password manager allows having very long and completely random passwords (e.g. M>?{tk6Cfep6BrZ4J)KZWQ8j) without the need to remember/write down. A strong passphrase is still required as a master key for to access the password manager.
