# Description
DTGInspector, otherwise known as Discord Token Grabber Inspector is a tool allowing to detect if a token grabber is injected in your Discord or in the user of your computer

# How to use DTGInspector

1) Download the [**lastest version**](https://github.com/thisisnzed/DTGInspector/releases/)
2) Drag the content of **DTGInspector.rar** in your desktop
3) Run **start.bat**
4) Wait for **results** (it may take up to a minute if you have a lot of discord versions)
