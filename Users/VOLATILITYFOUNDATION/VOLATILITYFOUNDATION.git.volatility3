# Volatility 3: The volatile memory extraction framework

Volatility is the world's most widely used framework for extracting digital
artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction techniques are
performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer
visibility into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended
to introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with
extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a
platform for further work into this exciting area of research.

In 2019, the Volatility Foundation released a complete rewrite of the
framework, Volatility 3. The project was intended to address many of the
technical and performance challenges associated with the original
code base that became apparent over the previous 10 years. Another benefit
of the rewrite is that Volatility 3 could be released under a custom
license that was more aligned with the goals of the Volatility community,
the Volatility Software License (VSL). See the 
[LICENSE](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/license/vsl-v1.0) file for 
more details.

## Requirements

Volatility 3 requires Python 3.7.0 or later. To install the most minimal set of dependencies (some plugins will not work) use a command such as:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

Alternately, the minimal packages will be installed automatically when Volatility 3 is installed using setup.py. However, as noted in the Quick Start section below, Volatility 3 does not *need* to be installed via setup.py prior to using it.

```shell
python3 setup.py build 
python3 setup.py install
```

To enable the full range of Volatility 3 functionality, use a command like the one below. For partial functionality, comment out any unnecessary packages in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) prior to running the command.

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Downloading Volatility

The latest stable version of Volatility will always be the stable branch of the GitHub repository. You can get the latest version of the code using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git
```

## Quick Start

1. Clone the latest version of Volatility from GitHub:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git
    ```

2. See available options:

    ```shell
    python3 vol.py -h
    ```

3. To get more information on a Windows memory sample and to make sure
Volatility supports that sample type, run
`python3 vol.py -f <imagepath> windows.info`

   Example:

    ```shell
    python3 vol.py -f /home/user/samples/stuxnet.vmem windows.info
    ```

4. Run some other plugins. The `-f` or `--single-location` is not strictly
required, but most plugins expect a single sample. Some also
require/accept other options.  Run `python3 vol.py <plugin> -h`
for more information on a particular command.

## Symbol Tables

Symbol table packs for the various operating systems are available for download at:

<https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/windows.zip>  
<https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/mac.zip>  
<https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/linux.zip>  

The hashes to verify whether any of the symbol pack files have downloaded successfully or have changed can be found at:

<https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/SHA256SUMS>  
<https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/SHA1SUMS>  
<https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/MD5SUMS>  

Symbol tables zip files must be placed, as named, into the `volatility3/symbols` directory (or just the symbols directory next to the executable file).

Windows symbols that cannot be found will be queried, downloaded, generated and cached.  Mac and Linux symbol tables must be manually produced by a tool such as [dwarf2json](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/dwarf2json).

Important: The first run of volatility with new symbol files will require the cache to be updated.  The symbol packs contain a large number of symbol files and so may take some time to update!
However, this process only needs to be run once on each new symbol file, so assuming the pack stays in the same location will not need to be done again.  Please also note it can be interrupted and next run will restart itself.

Please note: These are representative and are complete up to the point of creation for Windows and Mac.  Due to the ease of compiling Linux kernels and the inability to uniquely distinguish them, an exhaustive set of Linux symbol tables cannot easily be supplied.

## Documentation

The framework is documented through doc strings and can be built using sphinx.

The latest generated copy of the documentation can be found at: <https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

commit a59de1b918ec4bdbc4d7e5a3ead8f842ae2e84d5
Author: Gustavo Moreira <gmoreira@gmail.com>

    Updated to resolve merge conflict

commit 5679135f1aeb5ed82421eee37f3a57f6c0f97c53
Author: Gustavo Moreira <gmoreira@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Apr 28 08:12:06 2022 +1000

    The exception message is not accurate
    
     In the hypothetical case that the framework has a lower version than the module requirement, the message would be, for instance:
    'Framework interface version 2 is an older revision than the required version 2.2'
    instead of:
    'Framework interface version 2.1 is an older revision than the required version 2.2'

    Layers: Better checks on PAE page tables
    
    This checks that the very top level table points to the next four pages,
    as we'd expected in general. This relies on the same assumptions as the
    existing PAE detection did, ie that the PAE page_map maps the next four
    pages immediately.
    
    Previously we didn't check that the top page was valid, once we found
    the self-referential pointer.  This adds in an appropriate check to
    reduce false positives.
    
    Closes #631.

    Windows: Test unicode strings for length 0
    
    In some tests we were checking whether asking for the string value threw
    an InvalidAddressException through an error as to whether we should look
    elsewhere for the data.  As of commit 265b2825 we now treat 0-length
    strings as valid (as per #652), meaning we need to check for length 0
    as well as invalid pointers.
    
    If this crops up often, we may need to revisit the decision to make sure
    its in keeping with how windows treats zero length strings, but for now
    we only did it once for registry keys.
    
    Closes #665

    Plugins: Update yarascan options
    
    Add in a yara_source option in the process method.  Unfortunately
    yara_rules is still poorly named, but would require a major version
    bump, so to avoid major disruption, we're just adding the yara_source
    option instead.

    Renderers: Make appending rows massively more efficient
    
    Previously we were generating the list of children (for most likely the
    root node) for every single append statement, during which we were
    recalculating the length of the list, twice.  In plugins that output a
    lot of rows this would add an enourmous overhead (that likely grew as
    the length of the output grew).  Without this overhead, the time taken
    for the TreeGrid._append method went from 1230.0s to 2.4s.

    Windows: Improve PDB scanning regex
    
    The regular expression for finding PDB signatures didn't have an
    apprioriate flag to treat newline characters like normal characters,
    meaning that if a newline character occurred between the RSDS header
    and the name of the pdb file, the pdb signature would be missed.
    
    Also updated the filenames so that they're escaped, meaning it must be
    an actual dot for the extension rather than any character.
    
    Fixes #577

    fix pool scanners on some windows versions
    
    This fixes the size of _POOL_HEADER on 32-bit versions of Windows (was 16, should be 8). Also, get_object() is not doing enough validation and its returning too early. I turned that into a generator so it yields both valid and invalid objects, since the caller does validation anyway. Another way of fixing this is to pass the type_map and cookie from the caller into get_object() so it can do the proper validation and only return valid objects.

    Add patch for driverscan for windows 7 and earlier
    
    This patches an issue for some versions of windows that require the
    bottom-up approach for finding the size of "object body" by
    recognizing additional structures occupying the "object body"
    position. The sizes of these additional structures are added to
    the size of `_DRIVER_OBJECT` to more accurately compute the actual
    size of "object body".

    Windows: Ensure DTBs don't have all valid entries
    
    We were finding that PAE results were being masked by certain pages with
    64bit results.  The DTBs could be distinguished from good DTBs because
    every entry was valid (which for a 64-bit or even 32-bit DTB is
    extremely unlikely except on systems with *vast* quanties of memory.
    
    As such, this now tests for all entries being allocated and doesn't return the
    DTB if this is the case.

    Add patch for driverscan for windows 7 and earlier
    
    This patches an issue for some versions of windows that require the
    bottom-up approach for finding the size of "object body" by
    recognizing additional structures occupying the "object body"
    position. The sizes of these additional structures are added to
    the size of `_DRIVER_OBJECT` to more accurately compute the actual
    size of "object body".

    Windows: Fix up pdb.json for LF_UDT_MOD_SRC_LINE
    
    The module field in `LF_UDT_MOD_SRC_LINE` should be `unsigned short` instead of `string` as per:
    ```
    typedef struct lfUdtModSrcLine {
        unsigned short leaf;        // LF_UDT_MOD_SRC_LINE
        CV_typ_t       type;        // UDT's type index
        CV_ItemId      src;         // index into string table where source file name is saved
        unsigned long  line;        // line number
        unsigned short imod;        // module that contributes this UDT definition
    } lfUdtModSrcLine;
    ```

    This also changes the size of the struct from 16 to 14.

    Automagic: Changing stacking order for linux/mac
    
    The linux/mac stackers are more accurate (based on banners) than the
    windows stacker (based on offsets).  As such in cases where both would
    match, we should go for the more accurate match first (linux/mac) over
    windows.  In most cases this will make no difference because of the
    exclusion lists, so only one stacker will run, but in cases such as
    volshell where all stackers are run, this may help with certain edge
    cases.

    Windows: Ensure we set the kernel_virtual_offset before other reqs
    
    It appears in issue #524 that the step to fulfil symbol requirements
    can throw an exception (which then prevents the kernel_virtual_offset
    (which is optional) from being set appropriately.
    
    This sets the kvo first and adds a check to where it's set.  It doesn't
    get to the root of why an exception is thrown, but should ensure it's
    easier to spot if it goes wrong.
    
    Fixes #524.

    Fix issue #522: private attribute names mangle
    
    As per https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables
    Python will mangle private attribute names from `__attrname` to `_classname__attrname` to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses.
    This will happen even if subclasses are not involved i.e.: calling `type_member.__foo` from a plugin classmethod.
    Note that `__foo` is not meant to be a Python private attribute, but the actual name of the type member.
    Like sock.__sk_common here: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/62fb9874f5da54fdb243003b386128037319b219/include/net/sock.h#L354
    
    We need to strip the '_classname' prefix from the attribute's name before continuing with the member attribute lookup.

    Hello, this is very useful to optimize some scans, like in case of sandboxing, imagine:
    1 round it scans only all processes that was captured by sandbox aka pid_list
    2. round it scans all the rest processes ignoring pid_list from round 1
    
    if you have a better idea how to improve/implement this, let me know, we use our custom function, but i think it might be useful for the rest

    apply fixes and improvements for crash layer (see description)
    
    1) Remove empty newlines before the license
    
    2) Remove unused imports
    
    3) Add support for 32-bit Bitmap crash dumps
    
    4) Move _SUMMARY_DUMP to crash_common.json and fix the swapped Pages and BitmapSize offsets
    
    5) Fix other errors in crash64.json (swapped SystemTime vs SystemUpTime, PsActiveProcessHead should be unsigned long long, several incorrect offsets for other members
    
    6) Switched to new volatility3 namespace
    
    7) Reverted required_framework_version to (1, 0, 0)
    
    8) Fixed crashinfo plugin from unpacking the wrong number of values from layer.mapping(). Actually, the plugin no longer displays runs - it shows metadata instead.
    
    9) Address Ikelos' comments in PR #452

    Issues/optional symbol shift

commit 792fb7080c9ce0230e6638f590bcd0727a92a09d
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 7 23:23:40 2021 +0000

    Symbols: Set symbol_shift default rather than None
    
    Since all the checks for symbol_shift use essentially "if not
    config['symbol_shift']" is doesn't matter whether 0 or None is
    returned.  I'd like to test this on an ASLR image, but I think it should
    be fine and I'd feel much happier about everything if we could give it a
    numeric default.

commit 2402a51c609fd851702f4d4d8ffee456bdf5b7ec
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 7 23:01:04 2021 +0000

    Symbols: Make the symbol shift optional
    
    The symbol_shift isn't quite as nice as it could be, because we use None
    to demark an unset state, which is different than a value of 0 (because
    unset will trip linux to try to identify, whereas 0 will not).
    
    Every where we use the value, we get it from the dictionary and use 0 if
    it's not found (essentially forcing a default), but ideally, the default
    would be set.  As such, it's safe to set optional to true (and thus not
    require it for configuration files), but it's not ideal that the linux
    symbol finder can't determine whether to run or not without knowing
    whether the value's been intentionally set...

    Layers: Group the linearity settings together

commit f5ddb8880651e104d06db724c2e76a42df1236c4
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 27 16:48:53 2021 +0000

    Layers: Scan by available and then chunk
    
    This changes the order of scanning to make it (potentially) more
    efficient.
    
    A layer can efficiently map (and ignore large segments that don't exist)
    and then have the available space chunked, rather than creating all the
    chunks and repeatedly asking the layer whether each can be mapped or
    not.

commit 7a2ce9e9997df2abeed292cf7d576797e378cd85
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 27 00:25:06 2021 +0000

    Layers: Make linear scanning more efficient
    
    Previously we'd chop the entire space up into scan_chunk sized blocks
    and then chop those up into mapped chunks.  The mapping process can much
    more efficiently provide which blocks exist, so now we ask the layer to
    map itself in its entirety, and then any chunks of data we get, we cut
    into scan_chunk blocks.

    This duplicates config values if the requirement are identical, which

    In one of the earlier commits the varible was erased from being passed to vaddump - that corrects it.

commit 9150cd971beacd0980e73be33d45d23456017e50
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 17 22:04:55 2020 +0000

    Core: Change base class for FileHandlerInterface
    
    Python 3.6 doesn't appear to support IO[bytes] (and this is also from
    the typing library), so we instead now inherit from RawIOBase.  This
    provides read, but does not come with a constructor (like FileIO) so
    is suitable for our needs.
    
    Fixes issue #376.

    Plugins: Make open method clearer to use
    
    This highlights that the FileHandler class can also be seen as a method
    similar to open, and it removes unnecessary context managers, allowing
    plugins to close files as they wish (they must, however, remember to
    close the file for it to be committed).

    Yapf: Minor reformats for recent plugins
    
    Codebase: Ensure all conversions to bytes handle unicode
    
    All conversions using `latin-1` have been converted to
    `raw_unicode_escape` which is like `latin-1`, but handles unicode
    characters appropriately (with a `\u` prefix).
    
    Since this is like `latin-1` it should have no impact on things that ran
    previously, but those that would fail with a unicode error now will
    present an encoded unicode string.  There may be situations where the
    binary representation of unicode would be better (timeliner file
    output?), but those can be changed when/if it's determined necessary.
    
    Fixes #274.
    
    Linux: Fix keyboard_notifiers copyright year
    
    Renderers: Fix the pretty renderer when no rows are emitted
    
    Timeliner: Sort results and provide a filter
    
    Sorts the results (as stated).  Note that user interfaces may decide to
    sort their results in an order of their choosing.
    
    Also added a parameter that can be provided multiple times to only allow
    plugins that match (any of) the parameters provided.
    
    Timeliner: Actually make use of the TextIoWrapper

    Windows: Ensure all poolscanner API is public
    
    Remove the "protected" _ since other plugins may want to use it.
    At the moment we're the only consumer, so not bumping the version number
    of this (since it would be a major version number change), but we'll
    need to be careful of this in the future.

    Symbols: Resolve symbols returned from symbol_space.get_symbol
    
    This ensures that ReferenceTemplates are not returned from a call to
    symbol_space.get_symbol.  This is in keeping with the get_type method.
    
    The symbol_space containing all symbol tables has visibility of all
    tables and can cross-resolve amongst them.  Asking a specific table
    for a type may result in a ReferenceTemplate.  This feels like a
    better solution than having individual tables ask their parent space
    to fill in the details of sibling tables.
    
    Fixes #279.

    Linux: Fix keyboard_notifiers copyright year

commit 556c880c900073699ce4948034c93066dced4132
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 3 16:53:48 2020 +0100

    Codebase: Ensure all conversions to bytes handle unicode
    
    All conversions using `latin-1` have been converted to
    `raw_unicode_escape` which is like `latin-1`, but handles unicode
    characters appropriately (with a `\u` prefix).
    
    Since this is like `latin-1` it should have no impact on things that ran
    previously, but those that would fail with a unicode error now will
    present an encoded unicode string.  There may be situations where the
    binary representation of unicode would be better (timeliner file
    output?), but those can be changed when/if it's determined necessary.
    
    Fixes #274.

    Mac: Consolidate methods of listing processes
    
    This also updates all other plugins that rely on process listing
    and theoretically allows them to choose their preferred method of
    process listing.  At the moment, the default (first in the method list)
    is chosen.  An optional pslist_method StringRequirement can be added to
    each plugin, but using the list in the requirements could break if the
    pslist plugin is too old (ie, using the list would happen before the
    PluginRequirement gets checked).
    
    If this is a feature we want, it should be easy to add to all but
    netstat, which does not parameterize the list of processes.

    Objects: Make bool an int
    
    We can't inherit from bool, so __new__ can't return a bool, so
    everything has be done with int.  However __bool__ is already
    defined for int, so it should have no significant impact
    (other than type() calls).
    
    Fixes issue 232.

    Wintel: Reorder the DTB tests
    
    Reorder the DTB tests, since 64-bits have more to match and are likely
    more common these days.  We've had an instance where a 32-bit DTB was
    detected because of a self-referential pointer over a 64-bit DTB leading
    to an inaccessible image.
    
    This fixes issue #193.

    layers: Improve scanning of layered chunks
    
    Previously, for segmented layers, no chunk larger than a full segment
    was scanned.  Now, we combine contiguous segments up to
    scanner.chunk_size (or until a non-present segment) in order to scan it.
    
    This may be slightly slower (by concatting the data together) but gives
    results of hits across page boundaries (the point of the scanning
    capability), whereas previously each page was scanned individually.

    Objects: Fix incorrect Bitfield maths
    
    Turns out that #133 exposed a mistake in how we were using the end_bit
    field (and it should have been picked up in review, my bad).
    Essentially we were masking based on the length of the end_bit after
    *already* shifting by the start_bit.  We should mask then shift, not the
    other way around.
    
    May well fix issue #135 (pdb generation will have been affected by
    this).

    Ensure we use configured paths at import.
    
    Previously if submodules were imported after the plugin/symbol __path__s had
    been set, it would only use the __path__s from the constants module.
    
    We now use the parent module's __path__s to ensure we get the right
    sub__path__s.
    
    This seems better/more flexible than changing the original constants
    (since they'd no longer be constant) and allows people more chance to
    override things.  It brings with it potential confusion as a local
    plugin directory will need __init__ files with this magic to allow the
    core modules to run (since they come first in the path list).

    Fix a logging on add_process_layer exceptions.
    
    There were a number of issues with commit 3df5e995 that was applied in
    haste (notably, that exceptions wasn't imported in several cases, which

    Remove object validate method.
    
    With agreement from @attrc and @imhlv2, I'm removing the useless
    validate method from the object.  It defaulted to returning inaccurate
    information (validity undetermined, but validate returned True as if
    validation had happened) and is better handled by individual classes
    implementing is_valid (which seems the preferred nomenclature) and
    throwing exceptions if it's called on a class that doesn't have it.

    Add this as more of an example of how to cache.
    
    In a volatility object, we can use our own internal _vol variable to
    expose values externally, or just for us to cache.  It will override
    preexisting values though, so when used as a cache, best to make its key
    long and unique as possible.

    Revert "Add in no-dump option to certificates plugin."
    
    Arg, too much mind changing.  This option would make sense if the
    certificates plugin returned much useful information, but parsing
    certificates isn't easy in with just stdlib, and therefore dumping the
    certificates is the most sensible thing for this plugin to do (meaning
    no need for a no-dump option).
    
    This reverts commit 54918256524e3fa50aed00f4d14003cdd0064425.

    It makes more sense to allow each plugin to individually decide whether
    to produce files or not.

    Initial attempt at plugin versioning.
    
    So this allows people to alter the APIs for their plugins and allows
    plugins to verify the API is compatible with the one they expect.
    
    It adds a version property to Plugin classes, and has a SemVer checking
    method which can be called from other plugins to verify a plugin against
    a particular version.

    Make sure options are specific to each plugin.
    
    So this feels like a contentious decision.  It'd be awesome to have the
    options for the methods stored along-side the methods themselves.
    
    The downside with this is that the thing accessing the configuration
    data is always the plugin, so it's the plugin that must have requested
    the configuration option.  This is also important in case the
    description of the configuration option needs modifying for clarity or
    providing context for how it will be used.
    
    If the interface changes, all plugins calling the plugin methods will
    need updating, so the config options can be updated if necessary.

    Move to an object_from_symbol model
    
    Note: creation of enumerations can be done using Context.object, which
    should allow reference of enumeration members by normal type objects.
    
    If it turns out enumerations are never referenced from types, we can
    easily remove the try/except in the Module.object method.

    Limit modules to only accepting strings not templates.

commit 5362e2094edbe2fce8b9256577a0753e175b9dcb
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Aug 10 03:15:30 2019 +0100

    Initial attempt at cleaning up the API
    
    Context.object accepts a template or a string name (and now a type
    flag).  Module.object only accepts a string (because a template already
    has most of the stuff built in and might as well be passed to the
    Context.object constructor).
    
    The gotcha here is the absolute flag, which must now be set
    appropriately in all cases *except* where the module is constructed
    with an offset of 0 (whereby it will have no impact).

    Fix an issue we hit 1 in 1000 times.
    
    Turns out, that because the name consumption is fairly lax (often lots
    of excess space after the name, etc) we were reading 2 too many bytes
    (because we weren't taken the length of the leaf off the available
    length).  This would error when it so happened that a structure was at
    the end of the type list and we'd read past the end of the tpi stream.

    want to see the back of python3.5...

    Add in base __getattr__ to appease ObjectInterface vs Struct issues.
    
    Consider revisiting this at some point, it immediately throws an
    exception, so should cause significant slow downs (none detected on a
    reasonably fast machine, although buildbot will give a better idea).
    
    Without this a lot more specific typing will be required on the
    expectation that Structs will be returned rather than any other type of
    object.

    Remove validity checking in favour of static-type checking.
    
    This removes the assertions that checked plugin devs didn't do anything
    overly bad in favour of using mypy to ensure appropriate type-checking.
    
    It also moves the ProgressCallback typing information to constants in
    order to avoid circular imports (since constants doesn't import
    anything).

    Add in a rudimentary (read ugly) convertor for llvm pdb2yaml files.
    
    This will need some help from @npetroni in places, but produces
    close-to-identical JSON files for pdbs.
    
    It does not yet produce metadata, base_types, or any symbols (since
    they aren't exported by llvm-pdbutil's pdb2yaml) or base_types.
    Ideally all of those can be fixed over time, but the symbols will
    require changing llvm.  5:(

    Rejig pdbscan to find potential offsets then check them.
    
    Originally we found physical offsets for pdbs that matched,
    then found potential offsets and tested them against each other.
    
    Now, we find the potential offsets and then look for pdbs at that offset
    (technically within a 4Mb block after the start).  The scanning is quick
    (probably quicker than scanning the whole physical space) and should
    catch most pdbs unless they're splayed out in virtual memory.

    Fix memory problems with banner_caches.
    
    Since we stack using Mac layers as well as Linux layers, both sets of
    banner caches are required.  As the cache builders are separate at the
    moment, we previously ran banner searches without any banners.  This was
    bad.  It inflated memory hugely and killed the buildbot.
    
    We now bomb out on stacking a Linux or Mac layer unless we have banners
    against which to match.

Date:   Mon Dec 17 22:08:24 2018 +0000

    Remove long-broken convenience code from ConfigurableInterface.
    
    In the dim and distant past, I seemingly thought it a good idea to copy
    all the values out of an object's config and into local private
    attributes (I guess to avoid config lookups?).  It turns out, it was
    always broken because it looking at the root of the config tree, rather
    than under the object's specific config settings.
    
    This first turned up as an issue where self._meta_layer was being
    overwritten by None in the vmware layer.  Removing this resolved the
    issue.

    Mass reformat of typing imports
    
    Relented on the strict import of direct objects/classes for the typing
    module only.  Typing module components can be directly imported because
    it makes the code really painful to read and write otherwise.
    
    This is still in-line with the python style guide adopted from Google at
    http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html section 2.2.

    Remove the python implementation of __getattribute__ for speed.
    
    The __getattribute__ method is called for *all* attribute lookups, and
    the python implementation is likely slow.  The only function the python
    implementation provided was to check that properties started with
    helper_.  Since this only provided a log message, we could add it back
    in only if the log level is high enough?  Either way, it's not
    significant enough to warrant costing extra time in every attribute
    lookup on every object.

    Rework the array_of_pointers utility function.
    
    It now makes use of the original array's symbol table to get the pointer
    template, such that the size of the pointer is correct according to the
    original table.  Resolves "pointer.size" attribute errors (firing inside
    a property and thus throwing off unusual exceptions).

    Improve Module construction.
    
    The hash/size determination takes time, so make the hash generated on
    use (so far, only on dedupe) and cache it, since it shouldn't change.
    
    We also cache the Module construction, so that if it's done in a loop
    (like pslist), it won't keep recaculating for the same module.

    some dynamic ability, -f is returning for convenience purposes.

    Improve scan chunking for intel layers
    
    We now use mapping to skip unmapped pages when scanning.  This
    should be slightly quicker and likely more accurate.  We also now
    don't chunk over the size requested by the scanner.  We don't quite
    handle overlaps correctly yet (we overlap, but don't prevent
    duplicates if the pattern is entirely within the overlap segment).

    Add support for filename requirements
    
    At the moment these are no different than strings, but they allow us to
    do things like add URI handlers to file names if no scheme is provided,
    and eventually do file existence testing.  This also allows the web URI
    to allow uploads as a means of passing a file in.
    
    The configuration will only store the filename, because otherwise
    someone could add a huge file which would need to be carried around in
    the config forever after.  Handling file existence errors is up to the
    UI after the volatility library returns a "file not found" type
    exception.

    Vastly speed-up intel memory traversals
    
    This uses the exceptions to indicate how much can be skipped in the
    virtual intel translation layer.  This means large holes in the memory
    can be skipped more quickly.  It also eliminates the is_valid/mapping
    loop.

    Remove the unnecessary Volshell check in timeliner.
    
    Given that volshell's plugins are now separate and not stored in the
    core plugins list, there is no need to protect against it (and there are
    no other "interactive" plugins, which will likely be barred from being
    in the core set).

    I'm not entirely happy with this, it's an overly specific hard coded
    change, but luckily it's only for this CLI, it has no impact on other
    UIs, either text based on web based.
    
    I really don't want people to become reliant on this, but also I don't
    want to be that guy that stops people being able to do their work
    quickly for reasons of correctness.  May future volatility devs forgive

    Commit metadata changeset.
    
    Layers now accept metadata dictionaries (and chain/stack them on top of
    those from lower layers).  Metadata can only be set at construction
    time, and the metadata dictionary is readonly.  The hope is this will
    make enumerating metadata keys across the codebase simpler.
    
    The current metadata items that layers hold is:
    
    architecture (Unknown | Intel32 | Intel64)
    os (Unknown | Windows | Linux)
    pae (bool)
    page_map_offset (int)
    
    This patchset may develop further to help enumerate all of these
    (through a registration/reporting system).

    Make sure we don't get in a getattr loop.
    
    This appears to get in a loop when it's been unpickled by
    multiprocessing.  My guess is that it's trying to set _concrete_members
    without it being done in __init__ and there gets in a loop.
    
    We ensure then when doing a look-up inside __getattr__, it happens using
    __getattribute__.

    Fix broken type resolution
    
    The introduction of symbol resolution required subresolving "unnamed"
    (symbol named) types.  The resolution system was changed to pass
    constructed objects rather than names, which prevented the referencing
    from working properly.  This commit changes that bit back and creates a
    temporary *type* in the _resolved list for the symbol, then restores
    whatever was there before.
    
    We restore it so that people don't get used to looking up symbols using
    get_type (we may revisit this decision).

    Reuse the cache if we're within the same ResourceAccessor.
    
    This effectively means that the FileTranslationLayer will reuse the
    cached file even with multiple opens, but rerunning python, or starting
    a new context (with a new FileTranslationLayer but on the same URL) will
    cause a redownload whether necessary or not.  This ensures that running
    volatility as an engine (inside a long lived python session) will not
    prevent a file being checked again later.
    
    Other caching mechanisms (such as last-modified) should be used to
    determine if the cached file is still valid.
    
    Note this may cause issues if plugins run concurrently.

    Improve checks for invalid values
    
    We determine address_masks using log/ln2, which cannot accept 0.
    Therefore we don't support address spaces with a maximum_address of 0.
    This can affect registry hives, so we've added a check in registry hives
    to prevent creating layers with invalid maximum_addresses.

    Ensure that magic isn't a hard dependency.
    
    We rely on file extensions, but if we throw an Exception on a bad file
    extension then it's not really our fault.

Date:   Sun Nov 5 22:29:46 2017 +0000

    Add in support for looking for symbols in zip files.
    
    We use the jar scheme because that's actually registered with the right
    bodies, even if the syntax is a bit weird.  The contents is still
    processed by the ResourceAccessor meaning it can be compressed with any
    of the supported compression methods.

Date:   Sun Nov 5 21:27:56 2017 +0000

    Refactor the ResourceAccessor because it isn't an interface.
    
    It's not strictly limited to layers either, but I don't really want to
    create a whole extra generic file to put this in, so layers will do.

    Centralize the ISF locating code.
    
    This might benefit from a recache of the linux banners, although it
    should continue to work no recache is performed.
    
    We're now in a position to add support for loading symbols directly from
    zip files by altering the ResourceAccessor and adding code to the
    symbol finder.

Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Nov 4 17:09:59 2017 +0000

    Add in the capability to stash linux_banners.
    
    Since the stacker and Linux automagic will always be different objects
    (even if they're the same class), and we don't want to add OS specific
    code to the stacker, this is the simplest way of allowing the Linux
    symbol automagic to get information from the dtb finding stacker.

    Make sure we support windows filenames
    
    Consider refactoring out the various URL openning code into
    one that just returns the open file handle.  This would require changing
    the config option of "filename" to "location" and rejigging a few other
    bits elsewhere, but would centralize and make it more managable.

    Refactor the names given the new deprecation.
    
    The concept is to have a helper_ namespace, to ensure that

    This demonstrates that by renaming all extension properties to
    helper_<name>.

    Fix up interface versioning issues.
    
    Unfortunately one interface change was missed, getting the versions
    slightly out of alignment.  Due to the 2.1 schema already being
    published, the best course of action was to move to version 4.0.
    
    This means that there's a tiny chance some schemas exist somewhere in
    the world with a non-existant 3.0.0 schema.  Volatility will fail with
    an error saying they're not supported.  5:S  Sorry!

    Refactor the progress_callback so it can be used in automagics.
    
    Refactored the location of the progress_callback so that the UI can
    specify it and ensure it is used by the automagics process as well as
    the plugins themselves.
    
    The progress_callback function has also had an optional description parameter
    added, so that it can differentiated in case two scans happen
    simultaneously.

    Allow automagics to use natives without a set of global natives.
    
    This allows NativeSymbolTables to be appended to symbol_spaces and
    uses this to let automagic modules (which have no existing symbol table
    to rely on) to load natives for reading format data.

    Add in a heuristic for finding the correct DTB on recent Win10.
    
    This removes again the single_page_map_offset configuration value,
    and requires that a full/correct config be used to supply a manual DTB
    value.
    
    The expectation is that the single_page_map_offset feature be
    re-introduced but override *all* scanning (so the scanning doesn't take
    place even if the stacking does).

    Fix the truncation of strings
    
    MHL kindly pointed out that the string wasn't truncating, and it turns
    out I misread the struct documentation, which truncates or pads with
    \x00s to ensure the appropriate length.  We now truncate to the first
    null we find.

Date:   Mon Dec 12 02:08:32 2016 +0000

    Convert SymbolTableInterfaces to descend from ConfigurableInterface
    
    This allows SymbolTables to hold actual requirements (which
    IntermedSymbolTable already did, but without pulling in the right
    interface).  It means that values like kernel_virtual_offset get saved.
    
    We still need to figure out how to allow plugins to demand optional
    configuration values in other places (such as the kvo) but for now the
    plugin will barf if it doesn't get it.

    Ensure we only stack when needed
    
    We shouldn't be stacking unless we're required, so now
    we run after the construction phase, and run our own construction
    phase is we've changed anything.

    Use the physical layer and improve the output.
    
    The physical layer will miss certain patterns, but is an order of
    magnitude faster at scanning.  The main amount of time spent in scanning
    Intel spaces is counting through every page in the address space (32, 40
    or 64 bits), not the actual scanning.  There's no real way around this
    if you want to ensure you get every chunk of virtual memory.  Since the
    scanner could be stopped after its first hit, this might still be
    preferable, but should not be the default (particularly for an automagic
    scan).

commit d1b58143fe56714ba98d27e4560152c4f640e7ef
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 30 16:54:12 2016 +0000

    Add in UnresolvedTemplate type.
    
    This template type allows objects that have not been able to be resolved
    to exist within the symbol system.  It emits a debug message on creation
    so that intermediate format developers can identify potential issues,
    but does not raise an exception so as to allow partial tables to be
    used.
    
    If the UnresolvedTemplate is called (to create an object) before the
    symbol has been added to the symbolspace, it will fail with a
    SymbolError (as thrown by the individual SymbolTable).  For this reason,
    the class has been made private to the SymbolSpace class to prevent
    unexpected use.

commit 3dc161f9b452c459ea4c64c3a3cc424143302b69
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 22 02:20:10 2016 +0100

    Rework Translation Layers to tie more closely to configurations
    
    This change is quite signficant, and requires that TranslationLayers
    get all additional parameters that they need through their requirements.
    
    These are now automatically enumerated and populated on object
    construction based on the requirements, so should not require lots of
    repetitive filling out of fields.
    
    It does come with the downside that TranslationLayers can only be
    contructed with a context (and appropiate config), but TLs in particular
    always require a context (to contain the base layer) and blank configs
    can be constructed relatively easily (convenience functions can be added
    if necessary).
    
    This allows configuration trees to be built up, and their configs
    spliced into an existing config (as if it were being loaded from a
    file).
    
    Not all ConstructableRequirements use this method, since SymbolTables
    (for example) do not have access to the context or config_path in order
    to get to any parameters stored in the context's config.  They therefore
    are still passed their requirement values as __init__ parameters
    instead.

    Update the scanner interface to return all kind of objects.
    
    This one's slightly contencious, in that scanner now don't all return a
    uniform value, and therefore nothing can simply run through scanners.
    
    Worst case scenario we make a separate stricter interface that says it
    only returns offsets which will then allow things that need it to
    dynamically find them, but it's probably too useful to be able to return
    arbitrary objects of a type (as long as the objects returned are always
    of that type).

    Significantly rework the configuration system.
    
    So this is where I ripped out the guts of the dependency tree
    and made it a little better defined in some ways, and delayed
    populating it in others.  The validate function signature has
    changed and I'm still up in the air whether to validate with
    True/False or throw/catch exceptions.
    
    So now, configurables have a list of requirements, these are
    then bundled into a single requirement and can be passed to
    automagic.  Automagic runs a set of things over the deptree
    to help build/manage it.  These run in order of priority.
    
    The tree is still built from the top down, but now automagic
    can build branch from the bottom up and try and splice them
    into the tree where appropriate.  Hopefully this will make it
    easier to see follow.

    Add in Unions
    
    Since a Union is identical to a Struct (and at the moment a struct
    doesn't enforce non-overlapping members), these are identical and a
    Union is a descendent of Struct.  If this ever becomes a problem there
    is a filthy way to fix it, but it's really bad and will likely cause
    more subtle and difficult to diagnose problems.  Stick with inheritance.

commit 47a1390bb9000d7f3387d83f23a077cb83ba4b6a
Author: Mike Auty <mike.auty@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 31 03:03:20 2014 +0000

    Allow explicit dereferencing at a layer within memory.
    
    This is in contrast to volatility-2.x where object were automatically
    instantiated with a native_vm (or native_layer in 3.x parlance) and then
    any dereferences occurred in the correct layer.
    
    The space savings are now minimal since each object carries around only
    a layer name, and not a reference to the entire space.  However, given
    situations such as kernel structures containing pointers into
    process spaces, where the native_vm is useless, this decision is
    designed to make working on a particular layer explicit and therefore
    more obvious.  It may mean exposing that up through levels of functions,
    but hopefully it will make all the code more obvious and less
    automagical.
