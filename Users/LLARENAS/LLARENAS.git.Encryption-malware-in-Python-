# Encryption-Malware
This python program Encrypts everything with AES 256 bit algorithm.

To use the program, type on the terminal the following command,

        python <filename>.py <the directory from where you want to encrypt>
        
    e.g:- python encryption.py /   (So this will encrypt everything from "root")
    
  Do not run the above 'example' on your computer or else everything will get encrypted from the root of your computer.
  
To decrypt just comment out the decryption part and comment the encryption part(but not the key).
    
This is a very dangerous code. Use it with caution
