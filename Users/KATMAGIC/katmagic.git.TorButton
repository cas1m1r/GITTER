Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>

    Output from the transifex dance from translations.txt

commit 0e3eb8b23ab195b10c267d27e9115c42eb2125e1
Author: intrigeri <intrigeri@boum.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 30 14:41:04 2010 +0100

    Do not suggest using TorVM anymore.
    
    All languages were carefully edited but the zh-CN one I left apart since it did
    not seem a trivial replacement to do.

commit 293498d74b60577596e5680cdab2c22f2bd5b5f8
Author: intrigeri <intrigeri@boum.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 29 23:07:26 2010 +0100

    Take into account Amnesia is now called T(A)ILS.

commit 745a57ed69ed4052c89ed6c4d7846142fdd39f1b
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 3 16:53:13 2011 -0600

    Move the context menu.
    
    FF4 disables the addon-bar, which somehow propagates immutable invisibility
    status to the context menu there, so we move it to the nav-bar instead.  That
    was a fun one to diagnose.

commit 7a26c0c2ebc81b407ff1c76cd9c642d14c749c9c
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 3 16:38:56 2011 -0600

    Alter how we initialize the toolbarbutton.
    
    FF4 breaks how this event is delivered.

commit cc54f29aee6c0c1277868d16072df862b5f6c761
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 3 00:34:46 2011 -0600

    For some reason on FF4, we lack a content window for some observer events.

commit 34e7ca34461370b67cd4aaea75635c804ca0be0d
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Fri Dec 31 14:45:14 2010 -0600

    Make crash-observer use new FF4 APIs.
    
    Gotta love backwards-incompatible changes.

commit 2e10d59e271bd02810d76f9733a3ad6706932b2f
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 29 03:19:23 2010 -0600

    Simplify the crash recovery code some more.
    
    Eliminates weird behaviors for updating addons.

commit 0c214d6cc0f43a20eb16683989848c906109a4da
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 29 02:36:48 2010 -0600

    Trim down prefs for startup.
    
    They were too complicated and confusing. Lets just make it simple.

commit d496f02ae0ceeddb3227739128722e622730031b
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 29 01:32:36 2010 -0600

    Firefox 4 changed the session store format.

commit 27af24fe205a2b515feaac18bf3ac1268ee102c5
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 28 18:53:02 2010 -0600

    Explicitly write prefs to disk for crash detection.

commit 140453c75cbbb51402b093011c9a5167a7a173fe
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 23 22:20:01 2010 -0600

    Remove an expensive session-store log message for now.

commit e8ad5535ba65c16540b0c364a27fb5b629fb1a68
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 23 17:57:02 2010 -0600

    Fix crash observer.
    
    Was missing some events.

commit b78bb95ab4dd641dca408fef70a166c166f80a0a
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 23 01:24:02 2010 -0600

    Add code to insert the button into the toolbar.
    
    Hopefully this will help cut down on mode error. Oddly enough, found a FF4
    toolbar button issue related to a TabOpen event getting registered too early.
    Possibly also solves bug #1392 and #992?

commit 04124034588f65449e7d5e0dfdda22d1c7bdbadd
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 23 00:29:14 2010 -0600

    Downgrade session store log level.

commit 7ae437de6d1b121ba62f69a1c4ed2767dda612fa
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Sun Dec 19 16:49:06 2010 -0800

    Update history blocking to support FF4.
    
    This now involves only keeping places.history.enabled in sync with our prefs.
    The CSS history attack is now fixed in FF4, so we do not need to pay attention
    to the read pref.

commit 95d128234b4b95862922d52e7bf601ed3c3188aa
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 14 01:52:54 2010 -0800

    It's our friend the scary log message, back again.

commit 67bd1d97c6401e51eabf06185af7a0f908eb4cd6
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 14 00:02:56 2010 -0800

    Rewrite Session Store blocking support using new APIs.
    
    We now filter the JSON data written to the store instead of reimplementing the
    component used to create it. This is slightly less fragile than what we used
    to do, but perhaps not by much. If the structure of the session store changes
    substantially, we'll break. From the comments, it does look like they try to
    keep some level of compatibility with previous formats..

commit 6d3185447b0e36cca45f36d218cdb6d05a563949
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 13 23:38:15 2010 -0800

    Fix refspoofer logger reference.

commit a61cd27c3163846b8e06c1be8501012235b08d4c
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Sun Dec 5 17:53:26 2010 -0800

    Update Crash Observer for Firefox 4.
    
    Also simplify it. There's no real reason for it to hook the SessionRestore
    component. We will handle that via observer topics in a different component.

commit 513700cc742b98a24dc6d716dcb7a671f3d95c95
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 1 03:38:10 2010 -0800

    Fix toggle codepath for Firefox 4.
    
    Don't touch gopher settings for FF4. gopher support has finally been removed.
    RIP, archie. No one will miss you.

    Update the content window mapper to Firefox 4.

    Bug 1941: Maintain labels of search engine dtd items for translations.
    
    Also its not clear yet if duckduckgo can handle our traffic as the default.
    Plus I kind of like ixquicks's proxy feature, for when Tor is blocked by a
    link and Eris really wants you to work for that data ;)

    Clarify the search option a bit.
    
    Also add Yahoo. Despite the fact that they like to surrender their users
    over to their deaths, they are the 3rd most popular search engine, and
    they don't ban Tor.

    Fix bug 1321: Killing FF via the window close button ruins startup state.
    
    Turns out that when you tell the window manager to close the window,
    Firefox delivers the window close event and destroys the XUL *before*
    dispatching 'quit-application-granted', as opposed to after.
    
    This means the observer for this event needs to be moved into a component
    as opposed to living in the chrome XUL.

    reasons, but they are fully encrypted now, so for people who
    get all their addons from a.m.o it is not that big a deal.

    Make toggling a multi-step process marked by 3 prefs. May
    help fix/track some odd bugs with toggles not applying
    immediately, and help protect against potential race

    Revamp how we handle saving+setting Firefox preferences. Beef
    up "Restore Defaults" button and uninstall code to revert every
    pref we touch to the Firefox default, just in case. May annoy
    some advanced users, but at least the less experienced ones
    won't be completely helpless in the event we do wedge a pref.

    We should provide a pref to not store Non-Tor pages in the
    session store for people who want to always start their
    browser in Tor and not worry about all their non-tor pages

    "I hate weasel for making me write irssi scripts to redirect
    nsa to #tor-dev test commit #2."
    
    Also Torbutton probably won't release today anyways. Going to
    give it another day or so of testing since Tor itself hasn't
    tagged yet.

    Revert previous change. Let's leave the version that doesn't
    crash Firefox in the code.
    
    
    
    svn:r14774

commit 082fa67f82394ce972cd4c3087273fbc2fcef211
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Wed May 28 11:06:30 2008 +0000

    Commit alternate way of writing certs to disk. This one
    outright crashes firefox, so it's also no good (and less good
    than what we had). But I want a record of it in SVN.

Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Sun May 25 11:27:12 2008 +0000

    Sort prefs. Add support for firefox 3.0rc1: fixes bugs around
    history leakage and hooks; sets additional prefs to disabale
    history disk writes with places; fixes crash recovery and
    other hooks; sets new useragent spoofing prefs.
    
    Timezone spoofing currently NOT SUPPORTED in Firefox 3.0.

Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Sun May 18 00:04:50 2008 +0000

    Sink a ton of effort into fixing cert jaring performance and general
    behavior, only to discover that a Firefox race condition
    prevents us from doing this properly if the user toggles Tor
    quickly. Add code, but remove pref :(
    
    
    
    svn:r14656

commit 3dab1cead0fb0b4c097890f56821f380132327ff
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon May 12 08:26:02 2008 +0000

    Don't bother to ask the user if we should try to isolate CA
    certs even though they have none. Just set the pref to
    disable it after the first toggle.
    
    
    
    svn:r14593

commit 3656da9b6d1a417d68ced23ece2e1cc159d54b73
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon May 12 07:36:39 2008 +0000

    Man is CA cert isolation ever slow. If the user has no custom
    CA certs, ask them (once) if they really want to wait for us
    to check this fact every time they toggle tor.

    Sorry Alberto. Roger decreed this string was

    translated :)

    Let's try only resizing the window to 50px on document loads
    and manual resizes rather than on toggle and tab creation.
    Also, clear session history if the user requested to clear
    all history on toggle, check prefs for session history stuff,
    and fix a bug where we missed adding the session history
    listeners for new windows. Finally, re-enable safebrowsing,
    since there is a seperate authentication mechanism for it
    besides ssl.

    platform and extension information while Tor is enabled, and
    always hide Torbutton's presence to these checks inside and
    outside Tor. Fixing the other methods depends on Firefox Bug

    Damn, this was an ugly bug. Apparently window-scoped objects
    are destroyed when the window is closed, even if observer
    services take a reference to them.. The fix is to find a new
    window to install the global observers from upon main window
    close.

    Time to take the training wheels off. The hooking checks have
    became way more effort than they are worth to maintain,
    especially in light of the fact that same-origin windows
    seem to actually bleed scope into inner windows, where as
    non-same-origin windows do not. This is non-trivial to
    check for, it turns out.

    Restore doc checking code removed in r11723. Heh, prob
    shouldn't have removed this code. Turns out it's needed until
    we remove all the self-checks. (The XPCNativeWrapper for the
    contentwindow gets cleared on back/forwared, but the
    wrappedJSObject does not).  Thanks to Kyle Williams for
    finding this bug, among other things.

    Another possibility for bug #460. Apparently webprogress
    events are not delivered to tabs loading in the background.
    You need to subscribe to some other notification service
    instead. However, you only want one of these notifications
    running, which means you have to recieve a startup event.
    The chrome cannot recieve startup events, so you have to
    roll your own. XUL is fun.

    Usability improving rampage! Changed some defaults to be less
    intrusive on non-tor usage. Added ability to have both tor and
    non-tor cookie jars. Cookies are now properly synced before
    storing into a jar. Tightened up the alerts a bit more for the
    javascript hooking. Added options to start in Tor and reload
    cookies after browser crash. bug 503 update: prevent
    sessionstore from writing Tor tabs to disk instead of blocking
    it entirely.

    Bug 503: Fix the session store issue with the bloodiest hack
    imaginable. The SessionStore API has too many internal
    functions and timers to hook the published IDL and actually
    accomplish anything, so we're hooking nsIFileOutputStream and
    refusing to do anything if the filename is sessionstore.js.
    
    Also fix a few of our components to return null with error
    code instead of throwing exception on QueryInterface failures.
    (this seems to be the new way of doing things).

    Fix a pref type mismatch exception which may have caused
    some instances of bug #457 (and possibly #460). Tighten up
    the error reporting for Date hooking misses: remove all
    known false positives. Also, do not use parent browser
    object for tagging. Use only sub-browsers. This may have
    caused false positives for tag values, also causing
    occurances of bug #457 and #460.
    
    It is possible this patch entirely fixes both Bug #457 and
    #460.

    Differentiate between "crucial" and "recommended" settings in
    dtd strings. Add "Disable session saving" pref to disable
    session store, which can do surprising things if the browser
    crashes while you had Tor off (all your tor tabs would be
    reloaded without Tor). Not sure if that makes it a
    recommended or crucial setting.

    Turns out the Date hooks do not need to persist in the DOM - they can be
    inserted and immediately removed, which should fix rendering issues of
    text-only pages and some pages that depend on a specific unaltered DOM
    structure.
    
    Also, add a bit of code to clear cache every time Tor is toggled.

    ITS ALIVE!11 The Frankenpatching is a success. The patient lives! Integrated
    Collin Jackson's cookie jar and history wrappers. Also did some custom work to
    tag tabs so that torbutton remembers if they were fetched via Tor or in the
    clear, and disables javascript on those tabs that were fetched in an opposite
    state to the current one, and renables it when state changes back. Pretty
    neat stuff.

    Refactored common code between preferences and torbutton into torbutton_util.
    Merged in js Date hooking code and plugin toggling. Added (borrowed) icons.
    
    Code seems to work, but still has various stylistic and other issues that need
    to be resolved (grep for XXX).. But right now I'm interested in doing some
    experimentation on killing js events.. For that to be easiest, I really need
    to have a clean tree to diff against. Bombs away!

    Do not suggest using TorVM anymore.
    
    All languages were carefully edited but the zh-CN one I left apart since it did
    not seem a trivial replacement to do.

    Move the context menu.
    
    FF4 disables the addon-bar, which somehow propagates immutable invisibility
    status to the context menu there, so we move it to the nav-bar instead.  That
    was a fun one to diagnose.

    Alter how we initialize the toolbarbutton.
    
    FF4 breaks how this event is delivered.

    For some reason on FF4, we lack a content window for some observer events.

    Add code to insert the button into the toolbar.
    
    Hopefully this will help cut down on mode error. Oddly enough, found a FF4
    toolbar button issue related to a TabOpen event getting registered too early.
    Possibly also solves bug #1392 and #992?

    Update history blocking to support FF4.
    
    This now involves only keeping places.history.enabled in sync with our prefs.
    The CSS history attack is now fixed in FF4, so we do not need to pay attention
    to the read pref.

Date:   Tue Dec 14 00:02:56 2010 -0800

    Rewrite Session Store blocking support using new APIs.
    
    We now filter the JSON data written to the store instead of reimplementing the
    component used to create it. This is slightly less fragile than what we used
    to do, but perhaps not by much. If the structure of the session store changes
    substantially, we'll break. From the comments, it does look like they try to
    keep some level of compatibility with previous formats..

    Update Crash Observer for Firefox 4.
    
    Also simplify it. There's no real reason for it to hook the SessionRestore
    component. We will handle that via observer topics in a different component.

    they don't ban Tor.

Date:   Tue Apr 6 16:25:52 2010 -0700

    Fix bug 1321: Killing FF via the window close button ruins startup state.
    
    Turns out that when you tell the window manager to close the window,
    Firefox delivers the window close event and destroys the XUL *before*
    dispatching 'quit-application-granted', as opposed to after.
    
    This means the observer for this event needs to be moved into a component
    as opposed to living in the chrome XUL.

Date:   Tue Apr 6 16:25:52 2010 -0700

    Fix bug 1321: Killing FF via the window close button ruins startup state.
    
    Turns out that when you tell the window manager to close the window,
    Firefox delivers the window close event and destroys the XUL *before*
    dispatching 'quit-application-granted', as opposed to after.
    
    This means the observer for this event needs to be moved into a component
    as opposed to living in the chrome XUL.

    Perform automatic updates in all cases for FF3 by default. I
    suspect something is broken with toggling automatic updates
    in Firefox, so this is probably a good idea for that reason.
    It makes me slightly nervous for general fingerprinting
    reasons, but they are fully encrypted now, so for people who
    get all their addons from a.m.o it is not that big a deal.

    window. No automated checks yet.. we'll see how this works

    Make toggling a multi-step process marked by 3 prefs. May
    help fix/track some odd bugs with toggles not applying
    immediately, and help protect against potential race
    conditions that may exist due to Firefox Bug 409737. Also
    some fixes to "Restore Defaults".

    Revamp how we handle saving+setting Firefox preferences. Beef
    up "Restore Defaults" button and uninstall code to revert every
    pref we touch to the Firefox default, just in case. May annoy
    some advanced users, but at least the less experienced ones
    won't be completely helpless in the event we do wedge a pref.

    Fix the torbutton half of a Firefox 3-specific bug involving
    cookie jars. Firefox 3 still doesn't properly listen to
    "profile-do-change" events though, so cookies still aren't
    properly restored from jars. :/

    Add pref to close remoting window for Torbrowser. Pref only
    works on Windows. Linux and Mac ports rolled their own
    remoting code that is hidden somewhere else outside the
    standard component. Fun!.

    We should provide a pref to not store Non-Tor pages in the
    session store for people who want to always start their
    browser in Tor and not worry about all their non-tor pages
    flying through Tor during a session restore. Also, yay more
    strings.

    "I hate weasel for making me write irssi scripts to redirect
    nsa to #tor-dev test commit #2."
    
    Also Torbutton probably won't release today anyways. Going to
    give it another day or so of testing since Tor itself hasn't
    tagged yet.

Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Wed May 28 11:06:30 2008 +0000

    Commit alternate way of writing certs to disk. This one
    outright crashes firefox, so it's also no good (and less good
    than what we had). But I want a record of it in SVN.

    Sort prefs. Add support for firefox 3.0rc1: fixes bugs around
    history leakage and hooks; sets additional prefs to disabale
    history disk writes with places; fixes crash recovery and
    other hooks; sets new useragent spoofing prefs.
    
    Timezone spoofing currently NOT SUPPORTED in Firefox 3.0.

Date:   Sun May 18 00:04:50 2008 +0000

    Sink a ton of effort into fixing cert jaring performance and general
    behavior, only to discover that a Firefox race condition
    prevents us from doing this properly if the user toggles Tor
    quickly. Add code, but remove pref :(
    
    
    
    svn:r14656

commit 3dab1cead0fb0b4c097890f56821f380132327ff
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon May 12 08:26:02 2008 +0000

    Don't bother to ask the user if we should try to isolate CA
    certs even though they have none. Just set the pref to
    disable it after the first toggle.

Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon May 12 07:36:39 2008 +0000

    Man is CA cert isolation ever slow. If the user has no custom
    CA certs, ask them (once) if they really want to wait for us
    to check this fact every time they toggle tor.

    Let's try only resizing the window to 50px on document loads
    and manual resizes rather than on toggle and tab creation.
    Also, clear session history if the user requested to clear
    all history on toggle, check prefs for session history stuff,
    and fix a bug where we missed adding the session history
    listeners for new windows. Finally, re-enable safebrowsing,
    since there is a seperate authentication mechanism for it
    besides ssl.

    Damn, this was an ugly bug. Apparently window-scoped objects
    are destroyed when the window is closed, even if observer
    services take a reference to them.. The fix is to find a new

    close.

    Time to take the training wheels off. The hooking checks have
    became way more effort than they are worth to maintain,
    especially in light of the fact that same-origin windows
    seem to actually bleed scope into inner windows, where as
    non-same-origin windows do not. This is non-trivial to
    check for, it turns out.

    Restore doc checking code removed in r11723. Heh, prob
    shouldn't have removed this code. Turns out it's needed until
    we remove all the self-checks. (The XPCNativeWrapper for the

    Another possibility for bug #460. Apparently webprogress
    events are not delivered to tabs loading in the background.
    You need to subscribe to some other notification service
    instead. However, you only want one of these notifications
    running, which means you have to recieve a startup event.
    The chrome cannot recieve startup events, so you have to
    roll your own. XUL is fun.

    non-tor cookie jars. Cookies are now properly synced before
    storing into a jar. Tightened up the alerts a bit more for the

    cookies after browser crash. bug 503 update: prevent

    Bug 503: Fix the session store issue with the bloodiest hack
    imaginable. The SessionStore API has too many internal
    functions and timers to hook the published IDL and actually
    accomplish anything, so we're hooking nsIFileOutputStream and
    refusing to do anything if the filename is sessionstore.js.
    
    Also fix a few of our components to return null with error
    code instead of throwing exception on QueryInterface failures.
    (this seems to be the new way of doing things).

    Fix a pref type mismatch exception which may have caused

    the error reporting for Date hooking misses: remove all
    known false positives. Also, do not use parent browser
    object for tagging. Use only sub-browsers. This may have
    caused false positives for tag values, also causing
    occurances of bug #457 and #460.

    Differentiate between "crucial" and "recommended" settings in
    dtd strings. Add "Disable session saving" pref to disable
    session store, which can do surprising things if the browser
    crashes while you had Tor off (all your tor tabs would be
    reloaded without Tor). Not sure if that makes it a
    recommended or crucial setting.

    Turns out the Date hooks do not need to persist in the DOM - they can be
    inserted and immediately removed, which should fix rendering issues of
    text-only pages and some pages that depend on a specific unaltered DOM
    structure.
    
    Also, add a bit of code to clear cache every time Tor is toggled.

    ITS ALIVE!11 The Frankenpatching is a success. The patient lives! Integrated
    Collin Jackson's cookie jar and history wrappers. Also did some custom work to
    tag tabs so that torbutton remembers if they were fetched via Tor or in the
    clear, and disables javascript on those tabs that were fetched in an opposite
    state to the current one, and renables it when state changes back. Pretty
    neat stuff.

    Merged in js Date hooking code and plugin toggling. Added (borrowed) icons.
    
    Code seems to work, but still has various stylistic and other issues that need
    to be resolved (grep for XXX).. But right now I'm interested in doing some
    experimentation on killing js events.. For that to be easiest, I really need
    to have a clean tree to diff against. Bombs away!
