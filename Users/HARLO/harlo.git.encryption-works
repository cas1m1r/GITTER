    Confidentiality, anonymity, and getting more of the latter

commit 53c8734975f9725e1edacc1f8dfaf48ee3c6fc7b
Author: Noah Vesely <fowlslegs@riseup.net>
Date:   Thu Dec 3 17:34:43 2015 -0600

    Confidentiality, anonymity, and getting more of the latter
    
    First, this adds two paragraphs on confidentiality vs. anonymity to the "Threat
    Modeling" section.
    
    Then, in the Signal and OTR sections it adds information on how these
    technologies do not provide anonymity. In the OTR section, there was already
    some information to this regard. I've moved it into it's own subsection and
    added to it some.
    
    In this new "OTR, Metadata, and Anonymity" subsection, I've also added some
    information on how to use OTR over Tor on Android devices by using ChatSecure
    together w/ Orbot.
    
    Most of this was discussed in #214.

    Reinstitute Claws Mail warning, recommend Icedove
    
    This addresses the concerns @harlo laid out in
    https://github.com/freedomofpress/encryption-works/pull/218#issuecomment-158446798.
    The warning about the Claws Mail security issue has been preserved, while also
    informing new users that Icedove--which I explain is Thunderbird
    rebranded--should be their preferred Tails email client. Besides this security
    issue being fixed, this is also great because we already have instructions on
    Thunderbird and Enigmail usage.

    Tails no longer uses Claws by default. It does include it for compatibility with
    persistent volumes that were created before Icedove (Thunderbird rebranded by
    Debian) was made the default mail client. Therefore, this warning is no longer
    relevant for new Tails users.

    Originally, I was just going to change one double-hyphen to a proper em dash,
    but I went ahead and standardized our usage of em dashes. @trevor suggested no
    spaces before and after them. I don't think it matters as long as it's
    consistent—which now it is.

    Recommend FreeOTP authenticator
    
    Since Google Authenticator is no longer open-source, and there is FreeOTP which
    is maintained by Red Hat, it makes sense to recommend the former over the
    latter. (Especially, since a lot of sites will specifically instruct you to
    download Google Authenticator).

    Give Apple a fair shake
    
    I think our treatment of Apple is a little too tilted in their favor. I think to
    them privacy is a product; just like they are less than forthcoming about the
    sweatshop origins of their electronics, I believe it is reasonable to assume
    they are less than forthcoming about when and how they have cooperated with spy
    organizations. I have tried to keep this balanced and not go anti-Apple when we
    have no hard proof; I have just tried to balance our praise of their privacy
    policy by also preseting a more suspicious view (e.g., the added Appelbaum
    quote).

    The "Encryption Works" quote by Ed is fantastic,

    The title of the document should be formatted as h1.
    Some may disagree about formatting the subtitle as h2,
    since it's not a structural distinction, but rather
    a formatting aid for readability. The rationale is that
    the main title ("Encryption Works") should be as prominent
    as possible, since that is the title most folks will use
    when discussing the piece or referencing it.

    Correction: signatures versus checksums
    
    Original text equated checksums and signatures, which are two different things and processes (it referred to checksums but then gave the process for verifying a signature, and used them interchangeably). A checksum is a cryptographic hash that's unique to the exact contents of the file. A signature is an assertion about the checksum of a file by a public key (i.e. the developers). The edit now mentions both.

    Change Order of Paras in OTR/Logs
    
    Saying that we recommend turning off logs should come before instructions on how to do it, for teh sake of logical flow.

    Tighten OTR Logs Section
    
    * Lamo showed the conversation to the authorities, so I'm comfortable changing this section to reflect that Lamo's OTR client was logging the conversation.
    * Can't say that Lamo's HD wasn't encrypting the log file, so removed that reference.
    * Changed from both parties to just Lamo's device in re: the public record -- I've never seen anything to suggest Manning's side was logging.
    * General clarifications.

    - Introduce new form of encryption (to this chapter): transit encryption
    - Explicitly mention that GPG encryption is e2e
    - Clarifying the wording of e2e encryption and differentiating between transit and e2e encryption, since providers can/do circumvent one.

    Clarify Reference to Fingerprint Verification Methods
    
    There was originally a section here about using questions to verify someone in lieu of fingerprint verification, but the way the section was structured (including references to an MITM attack still being possible if your conversation partner knows things only she would know) seemed to undermine the legitimacy of these questions.
    
    Now, the section maintains that fingerprint verification's the best way to verify contacts (especially on Adium!) but on-the-fly methods (like Micah tweeting Snowden's fingerprint) are still decent. (My thinking is that it was rock solid in that case but won't always be -- not all of us have 11k followers on Twitter and a key signed by Cory Doctorow...)

    Fix PDF rendering
    
    * Remove leading '/' from image links so Pandoc's PDF generator can find
      the images.
    * Add tor_fpf.png and fix link, which was pointing to a URL on
      GitHub instead of a local file.
    * Re-export signal.png with Preview. For some reason this fixed the
      "! Dimension too large" error we were getting when rendering the PDF
      from the LaTeX source. I'm not sure why this worked, but it may have
      been related to [0].

    Confidentiality, anonymity, and getting more of the latter

commit 53c8734975f9725e1edacc1f8dfaf48ee3c6fc7b
Author: Noah Vesely <fowlslegs@riseup.net>
Date:   Thu Dec 3 17:34:43 2015 -0600

    Confidentiality, anonymity, and getting more of the latter
    
    First, this adds two paragraphs on confidentiality vs. anonymity to the "Threat
    Modeling" section.
    
    Then, in the Signal and OTR sections it adds information on how these
    technologies do not provide anonymity. In the OTR section, there was already
    some information to this regard. I've moved it into it's own subsection and
    added to it some.
    
    In this new "OTR, Metadata, and Anonymity" subsection, I've also added some
    information on how to use OTR over Tor on Android devices by using ChatSecure
    together w/ Orbot.
    
    Most of this was discussed in #214.

    Reinstitute Claws Mail warning, recommend Icedove
    
    This addresses the concerns @harlo laid out in
    https://github.com/freedomofpress/encryption-works/pull/218#issuecomment-158446798.
    The warning about the Claws Mail security issue has been preserved, while also
    informing new users that Icedove--which I explain is Thunderbird
    rebranded--should be their preferred Tails email client. Besides this security
    issue being fixed, this is also great because we already have instructions on
    Thunderbird and Enigmail usage.

    Remove ambiguous sentence from key signing section
    
    As pointed out in #195, there is a sentence which seems totally out of place
    here and it doesn't seem like it belongs in any of the nearby paragraphs as
    well. It might be an artifact from a deleted section or paragraph. Anyway, this
    commit removes it. Note to close #195 when this is merged.

    Tails no longer uses Claws by default. It does include it for compatibility with
    persistent volumes that were created before Icedove (Thunderbird rebranded by
    Debian) was made the default mail client. Therefore, this warning is no longer
    relevant for new Tails users.

    Standardize em-dash
    
    Originally, I was just going to change one double-hyphen to a proper em dash,
    but I went ahead and standardized our usage of em dashes. @trevor suggested no
    spaces before and after them. I don't think it matters as long as it's
    consistent—which now it is.

    Give Apple a fair shake
    
    I think our treatment of Apple is a little too tilted in their favor. I think to
    them privacy is a product; just like they are less than forthcoming about the
    sweatshop origins of their electronics, I believe it is reasonable to assume
    they are less than forthcoming about when and how they have cooperated with spy
    organizations. I have tried to keep this balanced and not go anti-Apple when we
    have no hard proof; I have just tried to balance our praise of their privacy
    policy by also preseting a more suspicious view (e.g., the added Appelbaum
    quote).

    The "Encryption Works" quote by Ed is fantastic,
    but listing it twice in as many paragraphs,
    within breakout blockquotes, is madness.
    
    Snips out the second appearance, favoring the first
    as setting the theme for the document and explaining
    the origin of the title.

Date:   Mon Sep 21 17:16:28 2015 -0400

    Adds URL for Freedom of the Press website.
    
    Rather than bolding the name of the organization,
    let's link to the website. The link didn't appear
    anywhere else in the document.

Author: Conor Schaefer <conor.schaefer@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 21 17:12:04 2015 -0400

    Moves license into paragraph about publishing info.
    
    Leaves the solitication for contributions in a separate
    paragraph.

Author: Conor Schaefer <conor.schaefer@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 21 17:08:36 2015 -0400

    Shortens license name, retains URL.
    
    Further abbreviation would be preferable, e.g.
    "CC BY 3.0" rather than "Creative Commons Attribution
    3.0 Unported". Either is an improvement over an
    unformated URL, though.

    Condenses attribution and removes from heading.
    
    Still crediting Micah, the original author. Tommy
    has put in a lot of work, so he's also named. Removes
    the header formatting and lists author names in
    paragraph style.

commit 63899aef52e35b63789e586e0f6e3851040a3354
Author: Conor Schaefer <conor.schaefer@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 21 16:53:34 2015 -0400

    Separates title and subtitle.
    
    The title of the document should be formatted as h1.
    Some may disagree about formatting the subtitle as h2,
    since it's not a structural distinction, but rather
    a formatting aid for readability. The rationale is that
    the main title ("Encryption Works") should be as prominent
    as possible, since that is the title most folks will use
    when discussing the piece or referencing it.

    The date ("August 2015") is already provided a few lines down.

    Reverse priorities in the design of Tails
    
    Not leaving a trace is more important than not having persistent malware.
    Also fixed sentence about amnesia.

    Adjust language about closed-source software
    
    The lack of fingerprint verification is not 'ipso facto' or 'per se' a shortcoming of closed source software.

    Fix reference to fingerprints
    
    The Signal section was moved up, and previously it appeared after fingerprints had been explained. Included a one-sentence definition to make up for that.
    Also fixed some spacing around em dashes.

    Remove Snowden quote from Citizenfour
    
    I don't think this quote adds anything. In the context of the film, I believe he was talking about TrueCrypt or something else like password management, and here it's included with regards to PGP. Replaced with modified language.

commit 4421e7ed1b8adfb36f7ea5892a32e01505bb8c87
Author: Kevin M. Gallagher <kevingallagher@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 18 17:03:11 2015 -0700

    Correction: signatures versus checksums
    
    Original text equated checksums and signatures, which are two different things and processes (it referred to checksums but then gave the process for verifying a signature, and used them interchangeably). A checksum is a cryptographic hash that's unique to the exact contents of the file. A signature is an assertion about the checksum of a file by a public key (i.e. the developers). The edit now mentions both.

    * Changed from both parties to just Lamo's device in re: the public record -- I've never seen anything to suggest Manning's side was logging.
    * General clarifications.

    Clarify Reference to Fingerprint Verification Methods
    
    There was originally a section here about using questions to verify someone in lieu of fingerprint verification, but the way the section was structured (including references to an MITM attack still being possible if your conversation partner knows things only she would know) seemed to undermine the legitimacy of these questions.
    
    Now, the section maintains that fingerprint verification's the best way to verify contacts (especially on Adium!) but on-the-fly methods (like Micah tweeting Snowden's fingerprint) are still decent. (My thinking is that it was rock solid in that case but won't always be -- not all of us have 11k followers on Twitter and a key signed by Cory Doctorow...)

    Fix PDF rendering
    
    * Remove leading '/' from image links so Pandoc's PDF generator can find
      the images.
    * Add tor_fpf.png and fix link, which was pointing to a URL on
      GitHub instead of a local file.
    * Re-export signal.png with Preview. For some reason this fixed the
      "! Dimension too large" error we were getting when rendering the PDF
      from the LaTeX source. I'm not sure why this worked, but it may have
      been related to [0].
